Preface to the Second Edition

306

When I wrote the first edition of Understanding Behaviorism, I wanted
to present a clearer and more up-to-date view of behaviorism than
was available in the books by B. F. Skinner that I was requiring my
students to read. Although my original insights still hold, that all
behaviorists agree that a science of behavior is possible, that this pro­
position defines behaviorism, and that whatever disagreements exist
among behaviorists arise from questions about how to characterize
science and behavior, for this edition I decided to focus less on Skinner's
ideas and more on my own. As a result, the book contains less behavior­
analytic jargon. By sticking closer to everyday vocabulary, the book is
still more accessible than it was initially.
I have corrected a number of faults that colleagues and students
pointed out to me. Chapters

2 and

3, which provide philosophical

background, are clearer about the link between radical behaviorism
and pragmatism and their divergence from folk realism and dualism.
I strengthened the discussions of both Ryle's ideas and molar behavior­
ism, Rachlin's view and my own. Throughout the book, presentations
are couched more in terms of molar behaviorism.
Some of the new material improves the relation to evolution as a
context. I clarified the role of ultimate consequences (health, resources,
relationships, and reproduction). I linked self-control, rule-governed
behavior, altruism, cooperation, and cultural rule-following together
by describing them all as competition between long-term and short­
term reinforcement. Chapter 13, about cultural evolution, now makes
the analogy to organk evolution clearer. Chapter 11, on relationships,
management, and government, now recasts counter-control explicitly
as self-control and incorporates a section on the security dilemma in
international relations. Chapter 14 now includes a specific example
of a proposal to improve democratic process. To help students avoid.

Acknowledgments

What Is Behaviorism?

In preparing this edition, I received help from two people in particular
- Howie Rachlin, with his supportive and friendly suggestions, and
Jack Marr, with his unrelenting and challenging criticism. I thank
Gerry Zuriff both for his criticisms and for sending me his students'
evaluations of the book. John Kraft also gave me feedback from his

use of the book as a text. I am grateful to the University of Canterbury,
New Zealand, where much of the rewriting was done, for giving me
an Erskine visiting fellowship, and particularly to Ant McLean, Randy
Grace, and Neville Blampied for helpful discussions while I was there.

I had helpful conversations with Michael Davison, Don Owings, and

Pete Richerson. Helpful suggestions came from Tom Mawhinney, John
Malone, and Phil Hineline. My son Gideon introduced me to political
scientists' theory and research about relations between national gov­
ernments. I am particularly grateful for the support of all my children,

Shona, Aaron, Zack, Naomi, and Gideon, and of their significant
others, Nick, Marcia, and Stacy.

Behaviorism has been a controversial topic. Some objections arise from
correct understanding, but misconceptions about behaviorism abound.
The three chapters in this part aim to clarify what might be called the
"philosophical stance" of behaviorism.
All that is genuinely controversial about behaviorism stems from its
primary idea, that a science of behavior is possible. At some point in
its history, every science has had to exorcise imagined causes (hidden
agents) that supposedly lie behind or under the surface of natural
events. Chapter 1 explains how behaviorists' denial of hidden agents
leads to a genuine controversy, the question of whether behavior is
free or determined.
Chapter

2 aims to forestall misconceptions that may arise because

behaviorism has changed over time. An earlier version, called methodo­

logical behaviorism, was based on realism, the view that all experience
is caused by an objective, real world outside of and apart from a
person's subjective, inner world. Realism may be contrasted with

pragmatism, which is silent about the origin of experience, but points
instead to the usefulness of trying to understand and make sense out
of our experiences. A later version of behaviorism, called radical beha­
viorism, rests on pragmatism, rather than on realism. Anyone failing
to understand this difference is likely to misunderstand the critical
aspect of radical behaviorism, its rejection of mentalism.
The behaviorists' critique of mentalism, explained in chapter 3,
underlies the remainder of the book, because it requires behaviorists
to suggest nonmentalistic explanations of behavior (Part Two) and
nonmentalistic solutions to social problems (Part Three).

Chapter 1

Behaviorism:
Definition and History

The central idea in behaviorism can be stated simply: A science of
behavior is possible. Behaviorists have diverse views about what this
proposition means, and particularly about what science is and what
behavior is, but every behaviorist agrees that there can be a science of
behavior.
Many behaviorists add that the science of behavior should be psy­
chology. This causes contention because many psychologists reject
the idea that psychology is a science at all, and others who regard it as
a science consider its subject matter something other than behavior.
Most behaviorists have come to call the science of behavior behavior

analysis. The debate continues as to whether behavior analysis is a part
of psychology, the same as psychology, or independent of psychology,
but professional organizations, such as the Association for Behavior
Analysis, and journals, such as The Behavior Analyst, Journal of the
Experimental Analysis of Behavior, and Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis,
give the field an identity.
Since behaviorism is a set of ideas about this science called beha­
vior analysis, not the science itself, properly speaking behaviorism is
not science, but philosophy of science. As philosophy about behavior,
however, it touches topics near and dear to us: why �e do what we
do, and what we should and should not do. Behaviorism offers an
alternative view that often runs counter to traditional thinking about
action, because traditional views have been unscientific. We will see
in later chapters that it sometimes takes us in directions radically
different from conventional thinking. This chapter covers some of the
history of behaviorism and one of its most immediate implications,
determinism.

What Is Behaviorism?

Historical Background
From Philosophy to Science

All the sciences - astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology - had their
origins in, and eventually broke free from, philosophy. Before astonomy
and physics existed as sciences, for example, philosophers speculated
about the arrangement of the natural universe by starting from assump­
tions about God or some other ideal standard and reasoning to con­
clusions about the way the universe must be. For example, if all
important events seemed to occur on the earth, then the earth must be
the center of the universe. Since a circle was the most perfect shape,
the sun must travel about the earth in a circular orbit. The moon must
travel in another, closer, circular orbit, and the stars must be in a
sphere, the most perfect three-dimensional form, around the whole.
(To this day, the sun, the moon, and the stars are called heavenly
bodies, because they were supposed to be perfect.)
The sciences of astronomy and physics were born when individuals
began trying to understand natural objects and phenomena by observ­
ing them. When Galilei Galileo (1564-1642) trained a telescope on
the moon, he observed that its crater-scarred landscape was far from
the perfect sphere the philosophers supposed it to be. Contributing to
physics also, Galileo recorded the motion of falling objects by rolling
a ball down a chute. In describing his findings, Galileo helped invent
the modern notions of velocity and acceleration. Isaac Newton (16421727) added concepts like force and inertia to create a powerful
descriptive scheme for understanding motions of bodies on the earth
as well as heavenly bodies such as the moon.
In creating the science of physics, Galileo, Newton, and other thinkers
of the Enlightenment broke with philosophy. Philosophy reasons from
assumptions to conclusions. Its arguments take the form "If this were
so, then that would be so." Science proceeds in the opposite direction:
"This is observed; what could be true that would lead to such an
observation, and what other observations would it lead to?" Philo­
sophical truth is absolute; as long as the assumptions are spelled out and
the reasoning is correct, the conclusions must follow. Scientific truth
is always relative and provisional; it is relative to observation and
susceptible to disconfirmation by new observations. For a long time,
astronomers thought there were only seven planets, but then an eighth
and a ninth were discovered. Philosophical assumptions concerned
abstractions beyond the natural universe: God, harmony, ideal shapes,

Behaviorism: Definition and History

and so on. Scientific assumptions used in theory-building concern
only the natural universe and the way it might be organized. Though
Newton was a theologian as well as a physicist, he separated the two
activities. About physics, he said, Hypotheses non Jingo (I do not make
hypotheses), meaning that when studying physics he had no concern
for any supernatural entities or principles - that is, for anything out­
side the natural universe itself. The reason the ocean has tides is not
God's will but the gravitational pull of the moon as it revolves around
the earth.
As well as physics, the ancient Greeks speculated about chemistry.
Philosophers such as Heraclitus, Empedocles, and Aristotle speculated
that matter varied in its properties because it was endowed with cer­
tain qualities, essences, or principles. Aristotle suggested four qualities:
hot, cold, wet, and dry. If a substance was a liquid, it possessed more of
the wet quality; if a solid, more of the dry. As centuries passed, the list
of qualities or essences lengthened. Things that grew hot were said to
possess the inner essence caloric. Materials that burned were said to
possess phlogiston. These essences were considered real substances
hidden somewhere within the materials. When thinkers turned away
from speculation about hidden essences and began making and inter­
relating careful observations of material change, chemistry was born.
Antoine Lavoisier (1743-94), among others, developed the concept
of oxygen from the careful observation of weights. Lavoisier found
that when the metal lead is burned and transformed into a yellow
powder (lead oxide) in a closed vessel, the powder weighs more than
the original metal, and yet the entire vessel retains the same weight.
Lavoisier reasoned that this could occur if the metal combined with
some material in the air. Such an explanation contained only natural
terms; it left out the hidden essences suggested by philosophy and
established chemistry as a science.
Biology broke with philosophy and theology in the same way.
Philosophers reasoned that if living and nonliving things differed,
that was because God had given something to the living things He
had not given to the nonliving. Some thinkers considered this inner
thing to be a soul; others called it vis viva (life force). In the seven­
teenth century, early physiologists began looking inside animals to
see how they worked. William Harvey (1578-1657) found what seemed
more like the workings of a machine than some mysterious life
force. It appeared that the heart functioned like a pump, circulating
the blood through the arteries and tissues and back through the veins.
As in physics and chemistry, such reasoning left out the hypothetical
assumptions of the philosophers and referred only to observations of
natural phenomena.

6

What Is Behaviorism?

When Charles Darwin (1809-82) published his theory of evolution
by natural selection in 1859, it created a furor. Some people were
offended because the theory went against the Biblical account of God
creating all the plants and animals in a few days. Darwin even shocked
some geologists and biologists. Familiar with the overwhelming fossil
evidence of the rise and extinction of many species, these scientists
were already convinced that evolution occurred. Yet although they no
longer took the Biblical creation account literally, some of them still
regarded the creation of life (hence, evolution) as the work of God.
They were no less offended by Darwin's theory of natural selection
than were those who took the Biblical account literally.
Darwin's theory impressed his contemporaries because it offered an
account of the creation of life forms that left out God or any other
nonnatural force. Natural selection is a purely mechanical process. If
creatures vary, and the variation is inherited, then any reproductive
advantage enjoyed by one type will cause that type to replace all
competitors. Modem evolutionary theory arose in the first half of the
twentieth century when the idea of natural selection was combined
with the theory of genetic inheritance. This theory continues to arouse
objections because of its godless naturalism.
Just as astronomy, physics, chemistry, physiology, and evolutionary
biology broke with philosophy, so psychology broke with philosophy.
Psychology's break was relatively recent. Until the 1940s few univer­
sities had a separate department of psychology, and professors of
psychology were usually to be found in the philosophy department.
If evolutionary biology, with its roots in the mid-1800s, is still com­
pleting its break with theological and philosophical doctrine, it is no
surprise that today psychologists still debate among themselves about
the implications of calling psychology a true science, and that laypeople
are only beginning to learn what a truly scientific psychology might
mean in practice.
In the last half of the nineteenth century psychologists began to call
psychology the " science of mind." The Greek word psyche means some­
thing more like "spirit," but mind seemed less speculative and more
amenable to scientific study. How to study the mind? Psychologists
proposed to adopt the method of the philosophers: introspection. If
the mind were a sort of a stage or arena, then one could look inside it
and see what was going on; that is the meaning of the word introspect.
This is a difficult task, and particularly so if one is trying to gather
reliable scientific facts. Nineteenth century psychologists thought that
this difficulty might be overcome with enough training and practice.
Two lines of thought, however, combined to undermine this view:
objective psychology and comparative psychology.

Behaviorism: Definition and History

7

Objective Psychology

Some nineteenth-century psychologists were uneasy with introspec­
tion as a scientific method. It seemed too unreliable, too open to per­
sonal bias, too subjective. Other sciences used objective methods which
produced measurements that could be checked and duplicated in labor­
atories around the world. If two trained introspectors disagreed over
their findings, the conflict would be hard to resolve; with objective
methods, however, one might note differences in procedure that could
produce different results.
One of the early pioneers in objective psychology was the Dutch psy­
chologist F. C. Donders (1818-89), who was inspired by an intriguing
astronomy problem: how to arrive at the exact time when a star is in
a certain position in the sky. When a star is viewed through a power­
ful telescope, it appears to travel at considerable speed. Astonomers
trying to make accurate time measurements were having difficulty
estimating to the fraction of a second. An astronomer would listen to
a clock ticking once a second while watching a star, and count ticks.
As the star crossed a line marked in the telescope (the "moment of
transit"), the astronomer would mentally note its position at the tick
just before transit, mentally note its position at the tick just after
transit, and then estimate the fraction of the distance between the
two positions that lay between the position just before transit and the
line. The problem was that different astronomers watching the same
moment of transit obtained different time estimates. The astronomers
tried to get around this variation by finding an equation, called the
"personal equation," for each astronomer that would compute the
correct time from the particular astronomer's time estimates.
Donders reasoned that the time estimates varied because no two
astronomers took the same time to judge the exact moment of transit,
and he believed they were actually making their judgments by different
mental processes. Donders thought that this " judgment time" might be
a useful objective measure. He began doing experiments in which he
measured people's reaction times - the times required to detect a light or
sound and then press a button. He found that it took a certain reliable
amount longer to press the correct one of two buttons when one or the
other of two lights came on than to press a single button when a single
light came on. By subtracting the shorter simple reaction time from the
longer choice reaction time, Donders argued that one could objectively
measure the mental process of choice. This seemed a great advance
OVer introspection because it meant that psychologists could do laborat­
ory experiments with the same objective methods as the other sciences.

What Is Behaviorism?

Behaviorism: Definition and History

Other psychologists developed other methods that seemed to meas­
ure mental processes objectively. Gustav Fechner (1801-87) attempted
to measure subjective intensity of sensation by developing a scale based
on the just-noticeable difference - the physical difference between two
lights or sounds that a person could just detect. Hermann Ebbinghaus
(1850-1909) measured the time it took him to learn and later relearn
lists of nonsense syllables (consonant-vowel-consonant combinations
with no meaning) to produce objective measures of learning and
memory. Others used the method developed by I. P. Pavlov (18491936) to study learning and association by measuring a simple reflex
transferring to new signals arranged in the laboratory. These attempts
held the common promise that by following objective methods psy­
chology could become a true science.

other animals consisted of casual observations of wild and domestic
creatures, often just anecdotes about pets or farm animals. With a little
imagination one could see a dog that learned to open the garden gate
by lifting the latch as having observed and reasoned from its owner's
example. One could imagine further that the dog's sensations, thoughts,
feelings, and so on must resemble ours. George Romanes (1848-94)
took this line of reasoning to its logical conclusion, even claiming that
our own consciousness must form the basis of our guesses at what­
ever dim consciousness occurs in ants.
This "humanizing the beast" or anthropomorphism seemed too specu­
lative to some psychologists. In the last part of the nineteenth and
early part of the twentieth century, comparative psychologists began
to replace the loose anecdotal evidence with rigorous observation
by conducting experiments with animals. Much of this early research
relied on mazes, because any creature that moves about, from human
to rat to fish to ant, can be trained to solve a maze. One could measure
the time the creature took to traverse the maze and the number of
errors it made, and one could see these decline as the maze was learned.
Carrying on the attempt to humanize the beast, these early researchers
frequently added speCUlations about the animals' mental states,
thoughts, and emotions. Rats were said to show disgust on making an
error, confusion, hesitation, confidence, and so on.
The problem with these claims about animal consciousness was
that they depended too much on individual bias. If two people intro­
specting could disagree over whether they were feeling angry or sad,
it was even more true that two people could disagree over whether a
rat was feeling angry or sad. Since the observations were so subjective,
making more observations was no help in resolving either disagree­
ment. John B. Watson (1879-1958), the founder of behaviorism, con­
sidered inferences about consciousness in animals to be even less
r�liable than introspection and concluded that neither could serve as
the method of a true science.

8

Comparative Psychology

At the same time that psychologists were trying to make psychology
an objective science, psychology was also being influenced by the theory
of evolution. No longer were human beings seen as separate from
other living things. The recognition was growing that not only do we
share anatomical traits with apes, monkeys, dogs, and even fish, but
we share with them also many behavioral traits.
Thus arose the notion of the continuity of species the idea that
even if species clearly differ from one another, to the extent that they
share a common evolutionary history, they also resemble one another.
Darwin's theory taught that new species came into existence only
as modifications of existing species. If our species evolved like any
other species, then it too must have arisen as a modification of some
other species. It was easy to see that we and the apes shared common
ancestors, that apes and monkeys shared common ancestors, that
monkeys and tree shrews shared common ancestors, that tree shrews
and reptiles shared common ancestors, and so on.
Comparative thinkers reasoned that, just as we could see the origins
of our own anatomical traits in other species, so we could see the origins
of our own mental traits. Thus the notion of making comparisons
among species in order to learn more about our own, coupled with the
assumption that our mental traits would appear in other species in
simpler or rudimentary form, gave rise to comparative psychology.
Comparisons between our species and others became common.
Darwin himself wrote a book called The Expression of the Emotions in
Men and Animals. At first, evidence of seemingly human mentality in

Early Behaviorism

In 1913, Watson published the article "Psychology as the behaviorist
views it," soon considered the manifesto of early behaviorism. Taking
his lead from objective psychology, he articulated the growing unease
among psychologists over introspection and analogy as methods. He
complained that introspection, unlike methods in physics or chemis­
try, depended too much on the individual:

1984). As long as I deliberate over eating the ice cream

itself is behavior that might be determined by heredity and past envir­
onment. If deliberation plays any role in the behavior that follows, it

Definitions
The idea that there can be a science of behavior implies that behavior,
like any scientific subject matter, is orderly, can be explained, with the

right knowledge can be predicted, and with the right means can be
controlled. This is determinism, the notion that behavior is determined
solely by heredity and environment.
Many people find determinism objectionable. It appears to run coun­
ter to long-standing cultural traditions that assign the responsibility for
action to the individual, rather than to heredity and environment. These
traditions have changed to some extent: delinquency is blamed on bad
environment; famous artists acknowledge debts to parents and teachers;

would act only as a link in a chain of causality extending back into
earlier events. This definition, however, deviates from what people
conventionally mean by free will.
Philosophers call the conventional idea of free will - the idea that
choice really can be free of past events - libertarian free will. Any
other definition, like those of Hebb and Dennett, that is compatible
with determinism presents no problem for behaviorism or a science
of behavior. Only libertarian free will conflicts with behaviorism.
The history of the concept in Jewish and Christian theology suggests
that it exists precisely in order to deny the sort of determinism that
behaviorism represents. Parting with the philosophers, therefore, we
will refer to libertarian free will as "free will."

and some behavioral traits, such as alcoholism, schizophrenia, handed­
ness, and IQ are acknowledged to have a genetic component. Yet the
tendency remains to assign credit and blame to individuals, to assert
that behavior depends not just on heredity and environment but on
something more, that people have freedom to choose their actions.
The name for the ability to choose is free will. It implies a third
element besides heredity and environment, something within the
individual. It asserts that despite inheritance and despite all environ­
mental impacts, a person who behaves one way could have chosen to
behave another way. It asserts something beyond merely experiencing
that one has choice - it could seem to me that I can eat the ice cream or
not, and yet my eating the ice cream could be entirely determined by
past events. Free will asserts that choice is no illusion, that individuals
themselves cause behavior.
Philosophers have tried to reconcile determinism and free will.
Positions have emerged called "soft determinism" and "compatibilist"
theories of free will. A soft determinism attributed to Donald Hebb
(a behaviorist; see Sappington,

1990), for

example, holds that free will

consists of behavior's dependence on inheritance and past environ­
mental history, factors less visible than one's present environment.
But, since such a view still considers behavior to result solely from

Arguments For and Against Free Will
Proving free will (in other words, disproving determinism) would
require that an act go counter to prediction even though every pos­
sible contributing factor is known. Since such perfect knowledge is
impossible in practice, the conflict between determinism and free
will can never be resolved by evidence. If it seems that middle-class
children from good homes who become drug addicts must have
chosen freely to do so because nothing in their backgrounds would
account for the behavior, the determinist can insist that further inves­
tigation would reveal the genetic and environmental factors that lead

to such addictions. If it seems that Mozart's musical career was
entirely predictable on the basis of his family background and the way
SOciety in Vienna worked in his day, the free-will advocate can insist
that little Wolfgang freely chose to please his parents with musical
efforts rather than to play with toys like the other children. If evidence

cannot persuade, then whether a person accepts determinism or free

will may depend on the consequences of believing one or the other,
and these may be social or aesthetic.

What Is Behaviorism?

Social arguments
Practically, it appears that denial of free will might undermine the
whole moral fabric of our society. What will happen .to our judicial
system if people cannot be held responsible for their actions? We are
already having trouble when criminals plead insanity and diminished
competence. What will happen to our democratic institutions if people
have no free choice? Why bother to have elections if choice among
candidates is not free? Belief that people's behavior can be determined
might encourage dictatorship. For these reasons, perhaps it is good
and useful to believe in free will, even if it cannot be proved.
Behaviorists must address these arguments; otherwise, behavior­
ism risks being labeled a pernicious doctrine. We will address them
in Part Three when we discuss freedom, social policy, and values. A
brief survey now will give an idea of the general direction taken later.
The perceived threat to democracy derives from a false assumption.
Although it is true that democracy depends on choice, it is false that
choice becomes meaningless or impossible without free will. The idea
that choice would disappear arises from an oversimplified notion of
the alternative to free will. If an election offers a person two different
ways to vote, which vote actually occurs depends not only on the
person's long-term history (background, upbringing, or values) but also
on events right before the election. Campaigning goes on for precisely
this reason. I can be swayed by a good speech, and without it I might
have voted for the other candidate. People need not have free will for
elections to be meaningful; their behavior need only be open to influ­
ence and persuasion (shorter-term environmental determinants).
We favor democracy not because we have free will but because we
find that, as a set of practices, it works. People in a democratic society
are happier and more productive than under any known monarchy or
dictatorship. Instead of worrying over the loss of free will, we may
more profitably ask what it is about democracy that makes it better. If
we can analyze our democratic institutions to discover what makes
them work, we might be able to find ways to make them even more
effective. Political freedom consists of something more practical than
free will: It means haVing choices available and being able to affect the
behavior of those who govern. A scientific understanding of behavior
could be used to increase political freedom. In this way, the know­
ledge gained from a science of behavior could be put to good use;
nothing requires that it be abused. And after all, if we really do have
free will, presumably no one need worry about the use of such know­
ledge anyway.

What about morals? Jewish and Christian theology incorporated
free will as the means to salvation. Without such teaching, will people
still be good? One way of answering this question is to point to that
part of humanity, by far the majority, that lacks this commitment to
the notion of free will. Do Buddhists and Hindus in China, Japan,
and India behave less morally? In the USA, the rise of public educa­
tion has increasingly moved moral training from church and home
into the schools. As American society leans more heavily on schools to
produce good citizens, behavior analysis is already helping. Far from
destroying morals, the science of behavior may be used to educate
children into good, happy, and effective citizens.
As for the justice system, it exists to deal with society's failures, and
we need not regard justice as a purely moral issue. We will always
need to "hold people responsible for their behavior" in the practical
sense that actions are assigned to individuals. Once the courts have
established that someone has transgressed, then practical issues arise
.
as to how to protect society from this person and how to make it
unlikely that the person will behave so in the future. Jailing criminals
has done little to prevent repeat offenses. A science of behavior could
help both to prevent crime and to treat it more effectively.

Aesthetic arguments
Critics of the notion of free will often point to its illogic. Even theolo­
gians who promoted the idea have puzzled over its paradoxical con­
flict with an omnipotent God. Saint Augustine put the matter clearly:
If God does everything and knows everything before it happens, how
is it possible for a person to do anything freely? Just as with natural
determinism, if God determines all events (including our actions), then
it is only our ignorance - here, of God's will - that allows the illusion
of free will. The common theological solution is to call free will a
mystery; somehow God gives us free will despite His omnipotence.
From a scientific viewpoint, this conclusion is unsatisfactory because
it defies logic and leaves the paradox umesolved.
In its conflict with determinism, godly or natural, free will seems to
depend on ignorance. Indeed, it can be argued that free will is simply
a name for ignorance of the determinants of behavior. The more we
know of the reasons behind a person's actions, the less likely we are to
attribute them to free will. If a boy who steals cars comes from a poor
environment, we are inclined to attribute the behavior to the environ­
Il1.ent, and the more we know about how he was abused and neglected
by his family and society the less likely we are to say that he chose

ond, even if animals could have free will, how could such a nonnatural
thing evolve? Natural traits evolve by modification from other natural

longer consider that politician's positions to be taken freely. When
we learn that an artist had supportive parents and a great teacher, we
wonder less over his talent.
The other side of this argument is that no matt�r how much we
know, we still cannot predict exactly what a person will do in a given
situation. This unpredictability has sometimes been considered evid­
ence of free will. The weather, however, is also unpredictable, but
we never regard weather as the product of free will. Many natural
systems exist, the momentary behavior of which we cannot predict in
advance but which we never consider free. Why would we set a higher
standard for a science of behavior than for the other natural sciences?
It seems illogical, and it is, because the argument from unpredictability
contains a logical error. Free will does imply unpredictability, but this
in no way requires the converse, that unpredictability implies free will.
In a way, it should even be false that free will implies unpre­
dictability. My actions may be unpredictable by another person, per­
haps, but if my free will causes my behavior, I should know perfectly
well what I am going to do. This requires that I know my will, because
it is difficult to see how a will that was unknown could be free. If I

decide to go on a diet, and I know this is my will, then I ought to

traits. One can imagine even the evolution of a natural mechanical
system that could behave unpredictably from moment to moment. But
no conceivable way exists for natural selection to produce a nonnatural
free will. This may be a powerful reason that some religious groups
oppose the theory of evolution; conversely, it is an equally powerful
reason to exclude free will from scientific accounts of behavior.
In fact, the whole reason for our discussing these arguments against

free will is really to show that scientific accounts of behavior exclud­
ing free will are possible. The arguments aim to defend the science of
behavior against the claim that human behavior cannot be understood
because people have free will. Behavior analysis cautions against the
use of the concept in arenas where it has unfortunate consequences,

11). Behavior analysis omits free will, but it places no ban on using

the concept in everyday discourse or in the spheres of religion, poetry,
and literature; clerics, poets, and writers often talk of free will and free
choice. A science of behavior might seek to explain such talk, but in no
way forbids it. In this book, however, we explore how to understand
behavior without mysterious concepts like free will.

my behavior, I should be able to predict my behavior perfectly.
The notion that free will causes behavior also raises a thorny prob­
lem. How can a nonnatural event like free will cause a natural event
like eating ice cream? Natural events can lead to other natural events,
because they can be related to one another in time and space. Sexual
intercourse leads to a baby just about nine months later. The phrase

leads to implies that the cause can be placed in time and space. By

definition, however, nonnatural things and events cannot be placed in.

would be natural.) How, then, can a nonnatural event lead to a natural
event? When and where does willing take place, that it can lead to my

eating ice cream? (Another version of the same problem, the mind­
body problem, will occupy us in chapter 3.) The murkiness of such

hypothetical connections led to Newton's Hypotheses non Jingo. Science
admits unsolved puzzles, because puzzles may ultimately yield to
further thought and experimentation, but the connection between free
will and action cannot be so illuminated. It is a mystery. Science's aim
of explaining the world excludes mysteries that cannot be explained.
The mysterious nature of free will, for example, runs counter to
the theory of evolution. First, it raises the problem of discontinuity.
If animals lack free will, how did it suddenly arise in our species? It

Summary
All behaviorists agree on one central idea, that a science of behavior
is possible. This science has come to be called behavior analysis.
Behaviorism is properly viewed as philosophy about that science.
All the sciences originated in and broke away from philosophy.
Astronomy and physics arose when scientists turned from philo­
sophical speculation to observation. In so dOing, they dropped any
concern with supernatural things, observing the natural universe and
explaining natural events by referring to other natural events. Sim­
ilarly, chemistry broke with philosophy when it abandoned hidden
inner essences as explanations of chemical events. As it became a
science, physiology dropped the inner vis viva in favor of mechanistic
explanations of the body's workings. Darwin's theory of evolution
was Widely perceived as an attack on religion because it proposed to
explain the creation of life forms with natural events only, and with­
out the supernatural hand of God. Scientific psychology, too, grew out
of philosophy and may still be breaking away from it. Two movements,

19

What I s Behaviorism?

Behaviorism: Definition and History

objective psychology and comparative psychology, promoted this break.
Objective psychology emphasized observation and experimentation,
the methods that distinguished other sciences. Comparative psycho­
logy emphasized the common origin of all species, including human
beings, in natural selection, and helped to promote purely natural
accounts of human behavior.
John B. Watson, who founded behaviorism, took his lead from com­
parative psychology. He attacked the idea that psychology was the
science of mind by pointing out that neither introspection nor analogies
to animal consciousness produced the reliable results produced by the
methods of other sciences. He argued that only by studying behavior
could psychology achieve the reliability and generality it needed to
become a natural science.
The idea that behavior can be treated scientifically remains contro­
versial because it challenges the notion that behavior arises from an
individual's free choice. It promotes determinism, the idea that all
behavior originates from genetic inheritance and environmental effects.
The term free will names the supposed ability of a person to choose
behavior freely, without regard to inheritance or environment. Deter­
minism asserts that free will is an illusion based on ignorance of
factors determining behavior. Since soft determinism and compatibilist
theories of free will affirm the idea that free will is only an illusion, "
they present no challenge to a science of behavior. Only libertarian
free will, the idea that people really have the ability to behave as
they choose (espoused by Judaism and Christianity), conflicts with
determinism. Since the argument between determinism and free will
cannot be resolved by evidence, the debate about which view is right
rests on arguments about the consequences - social and aesthetic - of
adopting one view or the other.
Critics of determinism argue that belief in free will is necessary to
preserve democracy and morality in society. Behaviorists argue that
probably the opposite is true - that a behavioral approach to sClCial
problems can enhance democracy and promote moral behavior. As for
aesthetics, critics note that free will is illogical when paired with the
notion of an omnipotent God (as it usually is). Whether actions are
determined by natural events or by God's will, they cannot logically
be attributed to an individual's free will. Supporters of free will retort
that since scientists can never predict an individual's actions in detail,
free will remains possible, even if it is a mystery. Behaviorists respond
that its mysterious nature is precisely what makes it unacceptable,
because it raises the same problem that other sciences had to over­
come: How can a nonnatural cause lead to natural events? Behaviorists
give the same answer as was given in the other sciences: Natural

events arise only from other natural events. This scientific view of
behavior argues against applying the idea of free will to law and
government, contexts in which it produces poor consequences for
society, but remains neutral about (and might explain) the use of the
idea in everyday discourse, religion, poetry, and literature.

experience of the tree, my perceptions, thoughts, and feelings are
inside me. This seemingly straightforward notion entails two not­
so-simple presumptions. First, this real world seems somehow to be

external, in contrast with our experience, which seems somehow to
be internal. Second, our experiences are of this real world; they are
separate from the world itself. As we will see, both of these may be
doubted, with remarkable results.
As with free will and determinism, philosophers have written a

answered the first question. Perhaps behavior is part of the natural
universe. Perhaps the way we would talk about behavior from a
scientific point of view contains something unique.
This chapter will focus on the first question. Chapter 3 will focus
primarily on the second question, although a full answer to the ques­
tion of what it means to study behavior scientifically will be fleshed
out by the rest of the book.
Radical behaviorists' ideas about science differ from those voiced
by both early behaviorists and many pre-twentieth-century thinkers.
Radical behaviorism accords with the philosophical tradition known
as

pragmatism, whereas earlier views derived from realism.

Realism versus Pragmatism

The objective universe
Several early Greek philosophers who lived in the sixth century BC
are credited with originating scientific thinking. One of them, Thales,
proposed a view of the universe that differed fundamentally from the
Widely accepted Babylonian view, which held that the god Marduk
had created the world and continued to govern all happenings in it.
Thales proposed that the sun, moon, and stars moved mechanically
across the sky each day, and at night moved around the flat earth back
to their places in the east to rise the next morning (Farrington,

1980).

However far this may seem from our ideas today, Thales's version
of the universe was useful. Farrington (1980, p. 37) comments, "It is

an admirable beginning, the whole point of which is that it gathers

together into a coherent picture a number of observed facts without
letting Marduk in." To put it positively, Thales proposed that the uni­

verse is a comprehensible mechanism.
In the context of realism, a comprehensible mechanism means a
real mechanism that is "out there," and exists independently of us. Its

universe comes to seem less puzzling. Its independent existence makes
it objective - that is, regardless of how our conceptions about it may
change, the universe remains just what it is.

the scientist studies sense data to try to learn about the real world. The
sense data, being internal, are subjective, but are the means to under­
stand the objective real world " out there."

Discovery and truth

Explanation

Realism implies a certain view of scientific discovery and truth.
we are learning about an objective universe that really is there (really
exists), then it is proper to say that when we study the universe scien­
tifically, we discover things about it. If we can discover something
about the way the universe works, it is proper to say that we discover
the truth about it. In such a view, bit by bit, discovery upon discovery,
we approach the whole truth about the way the universe works.

In the framework of realism, explanation consists of the discovery of
the way things really are. Once we know the orbit the earth takes
around the sun, then we have explained why we have seasons and
why the position of the sun in the sky shifts as it does. Explaining the
way the universe works is like explaining the workings of an auto­
mobile engine: The crankshaft turns because the pistons push it around
as they go up and down.
To the realist, explanations differ from mere descriptions, which
only detail how our sense data go together. Descriptions of the shifts
of the sun's position in the sky existed long before it was generally
accepted that the earth moves around the sun in an elliptical orbit.
Description only tells how things appear on the surface; once the
underlying truth about the way things work is discovered, then the
events we perceive are explained.

22

Sense data and subjectivity
To the realist, our approach to the truth is slow and uncertain because
we cannot study the objective world directly. We have direct contact
only with what our senses tell us. The philosopher George Berkeley
(1685-1753) considered this indirectness to throw the presumption
that the world is really there into doubt. He wrote in an essay called
"Principles of human knowledge":
It is indeed an opinion strangely prevailing amongst men, that houses,
mountains, rivers, and in a word all sensible objects, have an existence,
natural or real, distinct from their being perceived by the understanding
. .. yet whoever shall find in his heart to call it in question may, if I
mistake not, perceive it to involve a manifest contradiction. For what
are the forementioned objects but the things we perceive by sense?
and what do we perceive besides our own ide�s or sensations? (Burtt, 1939,
p.524)

In other words, since we have no direct contact with the real world;
but only with our perceptions of it, we have no logical reason
believe that the world is actually there.
Although some philosophers after Berkeley joined his
about the existence of sensible objects and accepted the idea that the
objects of the world are only inferences or a manner of speaking, philo-,
sophers of science tended to stick to realism and deal with Berkeley's
point differently. Bertrand Russell (1872-1970), for example, writing
in the early part of the twentieth century, substituted the concept of
sense data for Berkeley's "ideas" and "sensations." He proposed that

23

Pragmatism

Realism may be contrasted with pragmatism, a view that was devel­
oped by philosophers in the United States, particularly Charles Peirce
(1839-1914) and William James (1842-1910), during the last half of the
nineteenth century and early part of the twentieth century. The funda­
mental notion in pragmatism is that the power of scientific inquiry lies
not so much in our discovering the truth of the way the objective uni­
verse works, but in what it allows us to do (hence the name pragmatism,
from the same root as "practical"). In particular, the great thing that
science permits us to do is to make sense out of our experiences. It
makes our experience seem comprehensible; rain falls not because of
some mysterious god but because of water vapor and weather condi­
tions in the upper atmosphere. Sometimes science even allows us to
predict what will happen and, if we have the means, to control what
happens. We listen to weather forecasts because they are helpful. We
take antibiotics because they combat infection.
James (1974) presented pragmatism as a method for settling dis­
putes and as a theory of truth. Some questions seem to lead only to
endless arguments back and forth, with no satisfactory resolution:

What Is Behaviorism?

Behaviorism As Philosophy of Sci ence

Is the world one or many? - fated or free? - material or spiritual? - here

explain all the facts of experience. Instead, one theory often does well
with one set of phenomena while the other theory does well with
another set. James wrote:

are notions either of which may or may not hold good of the world; and
disputes over such notions are unending.The pragmatic method in such
cases is to try to interpret each notion by tracing its respective practical
consequences. What difference would it practically make to any one if
this notion rather than that notion were true? If no practical difference
whatever can be traced, then the alternatives mean practically the same
thing, and all dispute is idle. Whenever a dispute is serious, we ought
to be able to show some practical difference that must follow from one
side or the other's being right. (pp. 42-3)

In other words, if the answer to a question would in no way change
the way science would proceed, then the question itself is at fault and
merits no attention.
You might already have guessed that the question of whether there
really is a real, independent, objective world out there qualifies as one
of those questions about which dispute is idle. That is just how James
and Peirce regarded it. James wrote that our conception of an object
consists of nothing beyond its practical effects: "what sensations we
are to expect from it, and what reactions we must prepare" (p. 43).
What matters about a bicycle is that I see it, call it by its name, may
lend it to a friend, may ride it myself. Pragmatism remains agnostic
about whether there is a real bicycle behind these effects.
With such an attitude toward questions, pragmatism must imply
a special attitude toward the truth of answers. As a theory of truth,
pragmatism roughly equates truth with explanatory power. If the
question of whether there is a real universe out there is idle, then
so too is the question of whether there is some final, absolute

put it this way: Any idea upon which we can ride, so to
any idea that will carry us prosperously from any one part of
experience to any other part, linking things satisfactorily, wor
securely, simplifying, saving labor; is true for just so much, true in
far forth, true instrumentally" (p. 49). The idea that the sun and
move around the earth explained only why they move across
sky, but the idea that the earth orbits the sun while rotating on
axis is more true, because it explains also why we have seasons;
Strictly speaking, however, we will never know whether the
really revolves around the sun; another, even truer, theory could
ceivably come along.
In support of his view, James pointed out that in practice all
tific theories are approximations. Rarely, if ever, does one theory

25

and so many rival formulations are proposed in all the branches of
science that investigators have become accustomed to the notion that no
theory is absolutely a transcript of reality, but that any one of them may
from some point of view be useful. Their great use is to summarize old
facts and to lead to new ones. They are only a man-made language,
a conceptual shorthand ...in which we write our reports of nature .. .
(pp.48-9)

James's modern counterpart is Thomas Kuhn (1970), who wrote
The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. In this book, he argued that
science cannot be characterized as unending progress toward some
ultimate truth. Most of the time, during periods of "normal science,"
some puzzles yield to research and inquiry, while at the same time
new puzzles crop up. When too many puzzles remain unsolved, a
totally different way of viewing the domain of the science may begin
to gain acceptance and eventually overthrow the old view - a revolu­
tion occurs - and the new view (called a "paradigm") usually explains
more but different phenomena than the old view explained and
presents its puzzles, too. Such a conception of science might see it less
as a march toward ultimate truth than as a dance on a dance floor, in
which different dancers try out different steps and figures, and for
which every so often the band begins to play an entirely different
tune. Not to exaggerate, Kuhn pointed out that science does progress,
in that one paradigm replaces another in part because it explains more
phenomena. The dances and tunes get more sophisticated.

Science and experience
Pragmatism influenced modern behaviorism indirectly, as a result
of
a friendship between William James and the
physicist Ernst Mach
(1838-1916). James's effect on Mach shows in Mach's
book The Science
of Mechanics, a history that applied pragmatis
m to that branch of
physics. Since this book greatly influenced Skinner, and Skinner greatly
influenced modern behaviorism, in this roundabout way modern
beha­
Viorism owes a great debt to James.
FollOWing James, Mach argued that science has to do with experi­
ence and particularly making sense of
our experience. He considered
science to originate in the need for people
to communicate efficiently,
economically, with one another. Economical communica
tion is essential

What Is Behaviorism?

Behaviorism As Philosophy of Science

to human culture because it permits understanding about the world to
be passed easily from one generation to the next. Economy requires
the invention of concepts that organize our experiences into types or
categories, allowing one to use one term instead of many words. Mach
compared science to the body of knowledge possessed by artisans,
who he characterized as a social class that practices a certain craft:

interdependence - this is the business of physical science. It endeavors,
by comprehensive and thorough description, to make the waiting for
new experiences unnecessary; it seeks to save us the trouble of experi­
mentation, by making use, for example, of the known interdependence
of phenomena, according to which, if one kind of event occurs, we may
be sure beforehand that a certain other event will occur. (pp. 7-8)

26

A class of this sort occupies itself with particular kinds of natural pro­
cesses. The individuals of the class change; old members drop out, and
new ones come in. Thus arises a need of imparting to those who are
newly come in, the stock of experience and knowledge already pos­
sessed; a need of acquainting them with the conditions of the attainment
of a definite end so that the result may be determined beforehand.
(Mach, 1960, p. 5)

A potter's apprentice, for example, learns about different kinds of
clay, working the clay, glazes, firing, kilns, and so on. Without such
instruction, the apprentice would have no way to be sure what pro­
cedures to follow to get a good finished product. Without the concepts
that allow such instruction, each new generation of potters would
have to experiment and discover the techniques all over again. This
would not only be inefficient; it would prevent accumulation of know­
ledge over many generations. Imagine the state of house-building
today if carpenters had no way to benefit from the experiences of
carpenters a hundred years ago!

27

In other words, science creates concepts that allow one person to tell
another person what goes with what in the world and what to expect
if such-and-such happens - to predict on the basis of past experience
with such events. When scientists make up terms like "oxygen,"
"satell ite," or "gene," the one word tells a whole story of expectations
and predictions. These concepts allow us to talk about such expecta­
tions and predictions economically, without having to go through long
explanations over and over again.
As an example of the way science invents economical, summarizing
terms, Mach recounted the history of the concept " air." He began with
the time of Galileo (1564-1642):
In Galileo's time philosophers explained the phenomenon of suction,
the action of syringes and pumps by the so-called horror vacui - nature's
abhorrence of a vacuum. Nature was thought to possess the power
of preventing the formation of a vacuum by laying hold of the first
adjacent thing, whatsoever it was, and immediately filling up with it
any empty space that arose. Apart from the ungrounded speculative
element which this view contains, it must be conceded, that to a certain
extent it really represents the phenomenon. (p. 136)

Conceptual economy
As it is for any skilled performance, so it is for science. If I am teach­
ing you to drive a car, I would be foolish indeed to put you behind
the wheel and say, "Okay, go ahead and experiment." Instead, I
will explain to you concepts like starting, steering, braking, clutch,
accelerator, gears, and so on. Then you will know what to do if I say,
"When you are entering a curve, let up on the accelerator, and then if
the steering is easy, you can accelerate again." One might discover
such rules on one's own by experimenting, but it is a lot easier to be
told. Just as the concepts of clutch and accelerator allow one to pass
on understanding of driving, so scientific concepts allow one to pass
on understanding of experiences with other aspects of the natural
world. Mach wrote:
To find, then, what remains unaltered in the phenomena of nature, to
discover the elements thereof and the mode of their interconnection and

If you ever put a drinking glass over your mouth and sucked the air
out of it so that it would stick to your face, you felt the vacuum in the
glass "pulling" your cheeks into it. Nowadays we would describe this
as the action of air pressure. One crucial step in this change of view
was the observation that air had weight:
Galileo had endeavored . . . to determine the weight of the air, by first
weighing a glass bottle containing nothing but air and then again weigh­
ing the bottle after the air had been partly expelled by heat. It was
known, accordingly, that the air was heavy. But to the majority of men
the horror vacui and the weight of the air were very distantly connected
notions. (p. 137)

It was Torricelli (1608-47) who first saw the connection between
suction and the weight of air. He saw that a tube closed at one end,
filled with mercury, and inverted with the open end in a bowl full of

29

What Is Behaviorism?

Behaviorism As Philosophy of Science

mercury, would contain a vacuum at the top and a column of mercury
of a certain height below it. Mach commented:

What matters to the pragmatist is that in describing our observa­
tions we use terms that relate one phenomenon to another. When we
can see relations, see how one observation is connected to others, then
our experiences seem orderly and comprehensible, instead of chaotic
and mysterious. Mach argued that the job of science begins when
some events seem out of the ordinary, puzzling. Science then seeks
out commonalities in natural phenomena, elements that are the same
despite all the apparent variation. You puzzle over a statue of Mickey
Mouse on your employer's desk until you are told that it is a tele­
phone. As a child I was accustomed to the idea that things fall when
you let them go because they have weight and, therefore, was surprised
that a helium balloon would fly away if you let it go. Later in life, I
learned about the concepts of density and floating (common elements)
and understood that a helium balloon floats in air much as a boat
floats in water.
Mach argued that this process of describing a phenomenon in famil­
. iar terms is exactly what we mean by explanation:

28

It is possible that in Torricelli's case the two ideas came into sufficient
proximity to lead him to the conviction that all phenomena ascribed to
the horror vacui were explicable in a simple and logical manner by the
pressure exerted by the weight of a fluid column - a column of air.
Torricelli discovered, therefore, the pressure of the atmosphere; he also
first observed by means of his column of mercury the variations of the
pressure of the atmosphere. (p. 137)

Invention of the vacuum pump made possible many further
observations about what happens when air is exhausted from a vessel.
Many of these observations were made by Guericke (1602-86), who
had one of the first efficient vacuum pumps:
The phenomena which Guericke observed with this apparatus are mani­
fold and various. The noise which water in a vacuum makes on striking
the sides of the glass receiver, the violent rush of air and water into
exhausted vessels suddenly opened, the escape on exhaustion of gases
absorbed in liquids . . . were immediately remarked. A lighted candle is
extinguished on exhaustion, because, as Guericke conjectures, it derives
its nourishment from the air . . . A bell does not ring in a vacuum. Birds
die in it. Many fishes swell up, and finally burst. A grape is kept fresh in
vacuo for over half a year. (p. 145)

In Mach's view, the concept of air allowed all these observations
(i.e., experiences) to be seen as connected with one another. Without
it, they remained disorganized. The word air allows them to be spoken
of as related to one another, easily, and with relatively few words. The
concept provides our discussion with economy.

Explanation and description
In some of the quotes above, Mach suggests that the aim of science is
description. For realism, we noted that the aim of science was not
" mere" description, but explanation based on discovery of the reality
beyond our experience. In such a view, description only summarizes
appearances, whereas explanation speaks of what is really true. To a
pragmatist like James or Mach, there is no such distinction, because,
practically speaking, all that science has to go on is appearances that is, observations or experiences. For pragmatism, explanations are
descriptions in economical terms.

When once we have reached the point where we are everywhere able to
detect the same few simple elements, combining in the ordinary manner,
then they appear to us as things that are familiar; we are no longer
surprised, there is nothing new or strange to us in the phenomena,
we feel at home with them, they no longer perplex us, they are explained.
(p. 7)

Scientific explanation consists only in describing events in terms that
are familiar. It has nothing to do with revealing some hidden reality
beyond our experience.
You might be surprised at Mach's subjective tone: Events are
explained when we "feel at home" with them. Mach's point, however,
is that an event appears familiar (is explained) when it is described
in familiar terms. Although a pragmatist would view a familiar term
as just a term well learned, someone else might suppose familiarity
depends on feelings. In realism, what makes an event "familiar" is
nothing about the event itself (nothing objective) but something about
our experience with this or similar events (something subjective).
When a helium balloon rises, whether that event seems mysterious or
familiar depends, to the realist, on nothing about the objective event,
but about our subjective appreciation of the event.
In pragmatism, however, if we were to make a distinction between
subjectivity and objectivity at all, it would differ altogether from the
distinction made in realism. You could say that the conflict between
subjectivity and objectivity is for the pragmatist resolved in favor of

What Is Behaviorism?

Behaviorism As Philosophy of Science

subjectivity. Since there need be no objective real world, "objectivity,"
if it has any meaning at all, at most could be a quality of the scientific
inquiry. The move most consistent with pragmatism would be simply
to drop the two terms altogether.
It might seem peculiar that in some of the quotes above Mach uses
the word "discover" in speaking of scientists' activities. Discovery
seems to imply getting beyond appearances to the way things really
are, an idea consistent with realism. To Mach, "discovering" the
common " elements" in phenomena is the same as inventing concepts.
Each common element corresponds to a category or type, and its label
is the concept or term. This type of event we call "floating" - boats
float in water and helium balloons float in air. The behavior of the
helium balloon becomes comprehensible once we have invented (or
discovered) the concept of floating. Just as the distinction between
subjectivity and objectivity disappears for pragmatism, so the distinc­
tion between discovery and invention also disappears. Commenting
on the concept "air," Mach wrote, "What indeed could be more
wonderful than the sudden discovery that a thing which we do not
see, hardly feel, and take scarcely any notice of, constantly envelopes
us on all sides, penetrates all things; that it is the most important
condition of life, of combustiOn, and of gigantic mechanical phenom­
ena" (p. 135). Yet he could equally have said that air, the concept, was
a wonderful invention.
The interested reader should refer to Thomas Kuhn's The Structure
of Scien tific Revolutions for a discussion of the identity of discovery and
invention. Lavoisier, who " discovered" oxygen, discovered a new way
of talking about combustion. One could equally say that he invented a
new term, "oxygen."
In later chapters, particularly chapters 6 and 7, we will discuss
scientific terms again, because in the behavioral view neither word invention nor discovery - describes science so well as the idea that
scientific talk is, after all, behavior. We will see that a scientist is
someone who engages in certain types of behavior, including certain
types of verbal behavior. Right now, however, we continue at a more
general level and defer the more specific discussion to later.

natural experience (i.e., our experience of the "natural world"). The
goal of a science of behavior is to describe behavior in terms that
render it familiar and hence "explained." Its methods aim to enlarge
our natural experience of behavior by precise observation.
Radical behaviorists prefer pragmatism to realism because realism
leads to a dualistic view of people that is incompatible with a science
of behavior. If you say that the external world is real, that raises the
question " If I am separate from the real world, then where am I?" The
answer, according to folk psychology, is that you dwell in an inner
world, private to you, in which you experience sensations, thoughts,
and feelings. Only your external body belongs to the outer world. As
we saw in chapter 1, such a dualism is unacceptable because it intro­
duces mysteries such as " How does the inner self or mind influence
the behavior of the body?" No answer to this question will ever be
found because the inner self is separate from the natural world, and
we have no way to understand how nonnatural things can affect
natural events. We will discuss this point further in chapter 3. For now,
note that if we accepted inner-outer dualism, a science that dealt only
with external behavior would seem incomplete; indeed, behaviorists
have often been accused of ignoring the inner world of thoughts and
feelings. Radical behaviorism, however, rejects the dualism between
inner world and outer world. Instead, it considers behavior analysis to
deal with one world and behavior to be found in that one world.
The older view, methodological behaviorism, was based on realism.
Being realists, methodological behaviorists distinguished between the
objective world and the subjective world. Since science seemed to them
to concern only the objective world, they considered science to consist
of methods for studying the world " out there." Since realism assumes
that the same objective world is out there for everyone, whereas each
person's subjective world is different and inaccessible to anyone else,
methodological behaviorists thought that the only route to a science of
behavior would be through methods that were objective, that gathered
sense data about the world out there, the world that everyone shares
and could potentially agree about. The name methodological beha­
viorism derives from this emphasis on methods.
Although they might be surprised to hear it, most experimental
psychologists seem to be methodological behaviorists. They claim to
study something inside - mind, memory, attitudes, personality, and
so on - by making inferences about the internal world from external
behaVior, such as performance on estimation tasks, puzzles, paper­
and-pencil tests, or questionnaires. Since experimental psychologists
have no methods to study the inner world, however, they study outer
behaVior with objective methods. The only difference between this

Radical Behaviorism and Pragmatism
Modern, radical behaviorism is based on pragmatism. To the question
"What is science?" it gives the answer of James and Mach: Science is
the pursuit of economical and comprehensive descriptions of human

31

33

Behaviorism As Philosophy of Science

approach and methodological behaviorism is that the psychologists
make the inferences about the inner world whereas the behaviorists
would not. Early behaviorists like John B. Watson rejected such infer­
ences because they considered them to be unscientific. That is why
one may truly say of early behaviorism that it was the "psychology of
the other one," that it proposed for study only the public behavior of
a person that could be observed by someone else, and that it ignored
consciousness.
Radical behaviorism, in contrast, makes no such distinction between
the subjective and the objective worlds. Instead of focusing on methods,
it focuses on concepts and terms. Just as physics advanced with the
invention of the term " air," so a science of behavior advances with the
invention of its terms. Historically, behavior analysts used concepts
such as response, stimulus, and reinforcement. The uses of these concepts
have changed as the science has progressed. In the future, their use
may continue to change, or they may be replaced by other, more
useful, terms. In the chapters that follow, we will take up many terms,
old and new, and evaluate them for their usefulness. We will ask
again and again which terms make for economical, comprehensible
descriptions.
Another reason that radical behaviorism rejects realism is that '
realism leads to confusing definitions of behavior. In the context of
studying behavior, realism would hold that there is some real behavior
that goes on out in the real world, and that our senses, whether used
with instruments or in direct observation, only provide us with sense
data about that real behavior, which we never know directly. If, for
example, we make the objective observation that a man is moving his
feet one in front of the other rapidly in the street, someone might
object that this fails to capture the sense of the description that the
man is running along the s treet. And someone else might object that this
still falls short; the man might be exercising, running from the police,
or running a race. Even if we determine that the man is running
a race, he still might be described as training for the Olympics or
impressing his family and friends.
To the realist (methodological behaviorist), the best way to deal
with this diversity of possible descriptions is to stick close to the first,
to describe running in the street in as mechanical (objective) terms as
possible, perhaps even going into the muscles involved, because those
mechanical movements would supposedly bring us as close as we can
get to the real behavior. The man's reasons for engaging in this behavior
would be dealt with separately.
However, casting behavior as composed of limb and muscle
movements creates a troubling ambiguity. The same limb and muscle

movements may enter into many different activities. In our example
above, the runner's movements might be part of exercising or fleeing
the police. Since the movements are the same, the realist has to say it
is the same behavior, but by any reasonable definition exercising and
fleeing the police cannot be the same behavior.
The pragmatist (radical behaviorist), having no commitment to any
idea of real behavior, asks only which way of describing the man's
behavior is most useful, or in Mach's terms, most economical - that is,
which gives us the best understanding or the most coherent descrip­
tion. That is why radical behaviorists favor definitions of activities
that include the man's reasons for running, like exercising and fleeing
the police. A useful description might be "The man is running in a race
along this street as part of an attempt to enter the Olympics." Indeed,
we might refine this further by incorporating the reasons behind the
attempt to enter the Olympics and in other ways, as well, As we will
see in chapters 4 and 5, coherent definitions of activities must include
the function they serve; the reasons for engaging in the behavior are
part of the behavior itself.
How does radical behaviorism answer the question "What is
behavior?" The answer is pragmatic. The terms we use to talk about
behavior not only allow us to make sense of it, but also define it.
Behavior includes whatever events we can talk about with our invented
terms. Radical behaviorism inquires after the best ways, the most
useful ways, to talk about it, and if, for example, it is useful to say that
a person is running a race in order to qualify for the Olympics, then
running a race in order to qualify for the Olympics constitutes a
behavioral event. In chapter 4, when we take up some of the concepts
used by behavior analysts today, we will also be able to define behavior
more specifically.
This pragmatic emphasis on talk, terms, and descriptions - as
opposed to methods of observation - leads to one of the striking con­
trasts between methodological behaviorism and radical behaviorism.
Conscious phenomena, being among those things we can talk about,
are included in the study of behavior for the radical behaviorist. How
this is done, we will see in chapter 3.

32

Summary
The idea that a science of behavior is possible raises two questions:
(1) What is science? And, more specifically, (2) What view of science
applies to behavior? Radical behaviorists view science within the

What Is Behaviorism?

Behaviorism As Philosophy of Science

philosophical tradition of pragmatism. Pragmatism contrasts with
realism, the view adopted by many pre-twentieth-century scientists
and by early twentieth-century behaviorists. Realism holds that there
is a real world outside of us and that this outer real world gives rise
in each of us to internal experiences. The outer world is considered
objective, whereas the world of inner experience is considered sub­
jective. In realism, science consists of discovering the truth about
the objective world. Since, however, we have no direct knowledge
of the outer world, but only of our inner experience, which comes
to us through our senses, philosophers like Bertrand Russell argued
that science must proceed by reasoning from sense data what the
objective universe must be like. Our experiences of the real world are
explained when our reasoning leads us to the ultimate truth about
it. Pragmatism, in contrast, makes no assumption of an indirectly
known real world outside. It focuses instead on the task of making
sense out of our experiences. Questions and answers that help us to
understand the happenings around us are useful. Questions, such as
whether there is a real world outside of us, that can make no differ­
ence to understanding our experiences, merit no attention. There is
no absolute ultimate truth; rather the truth of a concept lies in how
much of our experience it allows us to link together, organize, or
comprehend. For pragmatists like William James and Ernst Mach, this
process of linking together various parts of our experience is what
constitutes explanation. In Mach's view, speaking effectively about
our experiences - that is, communication - was the same as explana­
tion. He argued that insofar as we can talk about an event in familiar
terms, the event is explained. To the extent that talking about events
in familiar terms is called description, explanations are descriptions.
Science discovers only concepts that render our experience more
comprehensible.
Whereas methodological behaviorism is based on realism, radical
behaviorism is based on pragmatism. Radical behaviorism rejects the
dualism of inner and outer worlds as inimical to a science of behavior
and instead proposes a science based on behavior in one world. To the
realist, real behavior occurs in the real world, and this real behavior
is accessible only indirectly, through our senses. Accordingly, the
methodological behaviorist tries to describe behavioral events in terms
as mechanical as possible, as close to physiology as possible. The
radical behaviorist looks instead for descriptive terms that are useful
for understanding behavior and economical for discussing behavior.
Pragmatic descriptions of behavior include its ends and the context
within which it occurs. To the radical behaviorist, descriptive terms
both explain behavior and define what it is.

Public, Private, Natural,
and Fictional

We saw in chapter 2 that radical behaviorism makes no distinction
between subjective and objective phenomena in the traditional sense.
It avoids all forms of dualism that would introduce unsolvable
mysteries. We will see in this chapter that, although it makes little
of the distinction between public and private events, which roughly
correspond to the objective and subjective worlds, it does draw some
other distinctions. The most important is between natural events and
fictional events.

Mentalism
The term mentalism was adopted by B. F. Skinner to refer to a type of ,
dualism - the separation of mental things and events from behavioral
events. Mentalism leads to a type of "explanation" that really explains
nothing. Suppose you ask a friend why he or she bought this pair
of shoes, and the friend replies, "I just wanted them" or "I did it on
impulse." Even though these statements sound like explanations, you
are really no further ahead than before you asked. Such nonexplana­
tions are examples of mentalism.
In discussing what defines a science of behavior, radical beha­
viorists often focus on distinguishing valid explanations from phony
explanations. For the pragmatists James and Mach (chapter 2), a valid
explanation was a description in comprehensible terms. In the same
vein, radical behaviorism seeks a set of terms that render an event like
buying a pair of shoes comprehensible. In developing such a set of
terms, it will be helpful also to see why terms like wan ted and impulse
fall short.

37

Public and Private Events
Public events are events that can be reported on by more than one
person. A thunderstorm is a public event, because you and I talk
about it together. Of course, many public events go unreported. We
may both hear a bird singing, but we don't necessarily talk about it. If
I hear the bird when I am alone, it is private only by accident, because
you and I could talk about it if you happened to be near.
Under ordinary circumstances, thoughts, feelings, and sensations
are private events, because only one person can report on them, even
if other people may be present. Aaron cannot tell what Shona is think­
ing right at this moment, because Shona's thoughts are private events.
Only Shona can report on her private thoughts.
Two points are important about this public-private distinction.
First, to the radical behaviorist the distinction is of little significance.
The only difference between public and private events is the number
of people who can report on them. Otherwise, they are the same
sorts of events, having all the same properties. Skinner (1969) expressed
this by writing, "The skin is not all that important as a boundary"
(p. 228). In fact, if recording from the brain could reveal what one
was thinking, the thinking would shift from private event to public
event, the only change being that now it could be observed by more
than one person. Thus, the kind of privacy involved is the privacy
you enjoy when you are alone. If I sneeze when I am alone, the
event is private only because no one else observes it. Even if we
lack the technology to read a person's thoughts today, the possibility
must exist that someday, with the right instruments, the thoughts
could be observed by more than one person. Basing the distinction
on some sort of privileged access that was forever insurmountable
would reinstate the old objective-subjective distinction in a different
form.
Second, public and private events �re both natural events. If I think,
It is a beautiful day, that is a natural event. If I say, It is a beau tiful day,
that is a natural event. If I go to the beach, that too is a natural event.
They are all of the same type.

Natural Events
Every science deals with natural events, whether moving objects,
chemical reactions, tissue growth, exploding stars, natural selection,
or bodily action. Behavior analysis is no different.

38

What Is Behaviorism?

The particular natural events that make up the subject matter of
behavior analysis are those that are assigned to whole living organ­
isms. The behavior of stones and stars is outside of the subject matter,
because these objects are not living. The behavior of a cell, liver, or
leg is outside because these are not whole organisms. However,
when my dog barks, that event (my dog's bark) belongs to the whole
organism (my dog). If I say, The sky is blue, that utterance (event) is
assigned to me; it is, so to speak, my saying of The sky is blue. The same
is true of private events. If I think, The car is making a new noise, that
event is assigned to me as a whole organism; it is my thinking. These
are the sorts of events that in this book we will simply refer to as
behavior, with the additional phrase " of the whole organism" being
understood.
Private events can be included in behavior analysis because science
requires only that events be natural; they must be observable in prin­
ciple - that is, they must be locatable in time and space - but they
need not be observable in practice. In chapter 2, we saw that one of .
Mach's points about air was that, although we observe many phenom­
ena that we attribute to air, we cannot observe air itself. If we could
contrive a way to make air colored, then we might observe it.

Natural, Mental, and Fictional
In everyday talk, all sorts of things are considered mental - thoughts,
feelings, sensations, emotions, hallucinations, and so on. Mental is the
adjectival form of mind. What do all the things called mental have to
do with the mind?
Most English-speaking people will assert that they have minds; many
would be insulted to be told they have none. Mindlessness is bad. It
seems that English has this theory built into it: To have a mind means
to have thoughts, feelings, emotions, and so on, and since we have
those, we are inclined to conclude that each of us has a mind. The
reasoning, however, is circular. The only reason we suppose that each
of us has a mind is that we all know we have thoughts - that is, we all
know that we think.
If we examine English constructions with mind in them, the word
seems to be used in two main ways. Sometimes it is a place or space,
a sort of arena or theater, as when we say, "1 have something in mind"
or "1 must be out of my mind." Sometimes it seems to be an actor or
agent, acting in its own right, as when we say, " My mind is made up"
or " 1 had a mind to tell him just what I thought" or "1 can see it in my
mind's eye." But where is this space or object? What is it made of?

Public, Private, Natural, and Fictional

39

The notion of mind is troublesome for a science of behavior, because
the mind is not a part of nature. We expect that if a surgeon opens
up your skull, inside will be a brain. The brain could be taken out,
held in the hands, weighed, have its volume measured; we could play
catch with it. Nothing of the sort could be said of your mind. At a
minimum, an object for scientific study should be locatable in time
and space. Your brain always has a certain location at a certain time.
The mind, in contrast, has none of the properties of a natural object.
The most revealing English phrases with mind in them are those in
which the word appears as a verb or in an adverb, as when we say,
"Mind how you go!" or "1 was minding my own business" or "1 was
mindful of the danger." These all suggest that mind or mindfulness is
a quality of certain types of behavior - deliberate, thoughtful, con­
scious behavior. Some behavior is called careful, some is called intelli­
gent, some is called purposive, and some is private. Whenever behavior
appears purposive, intelligent, or private, one is tempted to take the
further step of supposing that it involves the mind. But one need not,
and the radical behaviorist maintains that in a science of behavior
one must not. As we will see in later chapters, however, it remains
interesting to ask why certain behavior is called conscious, purposive,
or intelligent.
I cannot know that I have a mind the way that I know that I think,
sense, and dream. Thoughts, sensations, and dreams may be taken as
natural events (even if private) when observed by the one to whom
they belong. In contrast, the mind and all its parts and processes are
fictional.
To say the mind is fictional is to say that it is made up, make­
believe. I no more have a mind than I have a fairy godmother. I can
talk to you about my mind or about my fairy godmother; that cannot
make either of them any less fictional. No one has ever seen either
one. Once when I was giving a talk, a philosopher in the audience
objected that he was seeing the working of my mind as I was talking.
I was tempted to reply, "You are actually seeing the working of my
fairy godmother; she is here at my elbow, whispering in my ear." It
makes as much sense to regard speaking or problem-solving as the
workings of mind as to regard love and marriage as the workings of a
fairy godmother. One can do either, of course, for fun or in poetry, but
s uch talk is no help in a science.
Everyday talk about mental things and events includes both private
events and fictional things and events. Thinking and seeing are priv­
ate and natural, whereas mind, will, psyche, personality, and ego are
all fictional. When methodological behaviorists allowed public things
and events and ruled out mental (in the everyday sense) things and

What Is Behaviorism?

Public, Private, Natural, and Fictional

events, they ruled out private events and along with fictional things
and events. In contrast, radical behaviorists allow all natural events,
including both the public and the private, and rule out only the fictional.
The distinction between natural and fictional, moreover, has nothing
to do with how these are studied (i.e., methodology).
Fictional things and events are unobservable, even in principle.
No one has observed a mind, urge, impulse, or personality; they are
all inferred from behavior. A person who behaves aggressively, for
example, is said to have an aggressive personality. No one will ever
see the personality, though; one sees only the behavior.
Being unobservable, however, need not be a drawback. We have
seen the example of air, and other acceptable unobservable concepts
are easy to think of: atoms, molecules, radiation, electricity, genes. All
of these could be called inventions as much as discoveries, yet all are
considered valuable. So what is wrong with mental fictions?

Problems arise because the little person o r the self inside is auto­
nomous. If it were true that my outward behavior was only a result
of the behavior of this inner self, then a science of behavior would
have to study the behavior of this inner self. Studying the inner self is
impossible for the same reason that studying the inner homunculus is
impossible: Both are fictions that are made up to try to make sense of
behavior in the light of the prior division between " in here" and " out
there." A science of behavior based on such distinctions could never
succeed, any more than could a science of mechanics based on the
inner emotions of matter or a science of physiology based on an inner
vis viva. Instead, the events of interest are assigned to the objects under
study, the rock or ball in mechanics, the cell or tissue in physiology,
and the whole organism in behavior analysis.
When events are assigned to some hidden inner entity, not only is
scientific inquiry deflected toward the impossible task of understand­
ing the hidden entity, but also curiosity tends to rest. Further inquiry
is impeded not only by the seeming difficulty of the task, but also
by the semblance of an explanation being taken for the real thing.
These effects occur all the time in normal social intercourse, when a
person, asked "Why did you do that?" replies " I felt like it," or " I had
an impulse," or "The Devil made me do it." We are put off by such
evasions; it would be discourteous to inquire further, and the offering
of some sort of explanation keeps us from inquiring further. As scient­
ists, however, we would sooner or later have to see the inadequacy of
such nonexplanations and inquire further. This inadequacy brings us
to the second great defect of mentalism.

40

Objections to Mentalism
The idea of a mental world separate from behavior leads to the prac­
tice of invoking mental fictions to try to explain behavior. Mind, will, '
ego, and the like are often called explanatory fictions, not because they
explain anything, but because they are supposed to explain. The key
objection to them is that they fail to explain. They fail for two sorts of
reasons: autonomy and superfluity.

41

Autonomy: mental causes obstruct inquiry
Autonomy is the ability to behave. A thing is autonomous if we assign
its behavior to it. A person, a rat, or a fish is autonomous in this sense,
because we say that each behaves. No problem arises with assigning
behavior to whole organisms; a problem arises when behavior is
assigned to parts of organisms, particularly hidden parts.
The realist's view of behavior, which draws the distinction between
"in here" and "out there," seems to say that there must be a real me ­
my self somewhere inside who controls my external body. It is as if
I have a little person inside - a homunculus - who receives the sense
.
data from the sense organs and then controls bodily movements.
This little person is often depicted in cartoons and animated films as
occupying an inner control room with video screens, loudspeakers,
levers, and knobs. We easily see that this is no explanation of behavior,
but the realist's view, if less literal, falls prey to the same problems as
the homunculus.
-

Superfluity: explanatory fictions are uneconomical
Even if we overlook the way autonomous inner entities impede inquiry,
they are unacceptable because by normal scientific standards they
are not real explanations. All explanatory fictions, autonomous or not,
fall short. Apart from impeding inquiry, "The Devil made me do it"
and "My inner self made me do it" both fail as explanations. Even if
an inner impulse were not considered autonomous, "I did it on an
impulse" fails as an explanation for the same reason: The Devil, the
inner self, and the impulse are all superfluous.
Mentalistic explanations proceed by inferring a fictional entity from
behavior and then asserting that the inferred entity is the cause of the
behavior. When a person is said to eat vegetables because of a desire
for health or a belief in vegetarianism, such talk arises in the first place
because of the activity of eating vegetables; thus, the reason for saying

What Is Behaviorism?

Public, Private, Natural, and Fictional

there is a desire or belief is the activity. This "explanation" is perfectly
circular: The person has the desire because of the behavior and exhibits
the behavior because of the desire. We are no further ahead than
with the original observation, because to say that Naomi believes in
vegetarianism is to say that she eats vegetables. It may say something
more - that she reads vegetarian magazines, goes to meetings of a
vegetarian society, and so on - but her belief is still inferred from her
behavior.
The science of mechanics faced the same sort of problem when
horror vacui was thought to explain the facts of suction, and physiology
faced it when vis viva was thought to explain cell metabolism. Horror
vacui was inferred from the facts of suction; vis viva was inferred from
cell metabolism. These inferred causes cannot truly be said to explain
at all because they offer no simpler view of suction or cell metabolism.
Instead, they sit, so to speak, behind the observed events, mysteri­
ously producing them.
Horror vacui, vis viva, and mental fictions are all equally useless
because, to use Mach's term, they are uneconomical. Mental fictions
are uneconomical because, instead of simplifying our perception of
events by describing them with a few uriderstood concepts, they make
matters more complicated, in two ways. First, as we have already
seen, they merely restate the original observation with some added
superfluous concept. If we accepted the idea that Naomi eats veget­
ables because of her belief in vegetarianism, now we would have to
explain both her eating habits and her belief, whereas before we only
had to explain her eating habits. If what I say depends on what my
fairy godmother tells me, then we would need to explain both her
telling me and my listening to her.
Second, this added concept has no clear relationship to the observed
events. If a teenager is said to steal cars because of low self-esteem, we
now have to wonder how this low self-esteem could lead to stealing
cars. In chapter 1 we saw that one problem with the notion of free will
is that the connection between free will, a nonnatural event, and eat­
ing ice cream, a natural event, remains forever a mystery. The same
problem arises with any supposed event in the mind. In this context,
the problem is called the mind-body problem and expressed: How can
a nonnatural thing affect a natural thing? Mental causes all pose this
mysterious-connection problem. Like the mind, all fictional mental
causes, if they existed, would be nonnatural. They cannot be found in
the body - no one has ever found a belief, attitude, personality, or ego
in anyone's heart, liver, or brain. They are never measured, except by
behavior, such as answers to a questionnaire. How can such things
cause behavior?

The mind-body problem has never been and never will be solved,
because it is a pseudo-question, a question that itself makes no sense.
How many angels can dance on the head of a pin? What happens
when an irresistible force encounters an immoveable object? Each of
these questions implies a nonsensical premise - that an angel could
dance on the head of a pin or that an irresistible force could coexist
with an immoveable object. The nonsensical premise underlying the
mind-body question is the idea that fictions like a mind, an attitude,
or a belief could cause behavior at all.
A common response to this argument is to suggest that attitudes,
beliefs, wishes, and the like exist as things in the brain. The present
level of understanding of the brain, however, allows no such asser­
tion. Perhaps someday the working of the brain will be well enough
understood to shed light on the mechanisms underlying studying for
an examination or robbing a store, but that day appears to lie far in
the future, if it will ever arrive at all. Behavior analysis needs to wait
on discoveries about the nervous system no more than physiology
needed to wait on discoveries about biochemistry. Nowadays cell func­
tion is often explained with biochemistry, but physiologists under­
stood cell function with concepts like membrane, osmosis, metabolism,
and mitosis before chemists were any help at all. Similarly, behavior
analysis can understand behavior at the level of its interaction with
the environment without any help from neurophysiologists. Indeed,
when help from the neurophysiologists is forthcoming, behavior
analysts will have described the phenomena that could be explained
further by reference to bodily mechanisms.
The radical behaviorist's objection to mentalism is really an objec­
tion to dualism, the idea that two sorts of existence, material and
nonmaterial, or two sorts of terms, referring to the material and the
nonmaterial, are necessary to understand behavior fully. All the sci­
ences, not just behavior analysis, reject dualism because it is confusing
and uneconomical. When Newton said, Hypotheses non Jingo (I do not
make hypotheses), by hypotheses he meant nonmaterial, supernatural
causes somehow underlying natural events.
The writings of Rene Descartes (1596-1650) were influential in
establishing dualism in psychology. Although Descartes made many
wonderful contributions to mathematics and philosophy, his view of
behavior impeded any scientific approach. He proposed that the bodies
of animals and humans were complicated machines, working according
to simple natural mechanisms. He thought the brain and nerves were
filled with a thin fluid - animal spirits - which flowed to the muscles to
cause action. In accordance with Christian theology, he maintained
that, whereas animals were merely machines, humans had in addition

42

43

What Is Behaviorism?

Public, Private, Natural, and Fictional

a soul. He thought the soul influenced behavior by moving a gland in
the middle of the brain, the pineal gland, which affected the flow of
the animal spirits. Although this particular idea never caught on, the
notion that human behavior depends on the soul remained. Later, as
psychology grew more scientific, psychologists distanced themselves
from Christian theology by replacing the soul with the mind. Neither
the pineal gland nor the mind solved the problem raised by Descartes's
dualism: the mystery of the ghost in the machine. Even if the movements
of the pineal gland did affect behavior, the mystery remains: How
does the soul move the pineal gland? Even if the mind is not transcend­
ental, it is still nonmaterial (nonnatural) and, in relation to behavior,
just as ghostly as the soul. A science has no room for such mysteries.

Suppose our game switches to naming instances of intelligent beha­
vior. Players suggest doing long division, playing chess, designing
a house, creating choreography, and so on. Then someone suggests
intelligence. This would seem mistaken, according to Ryle's view, for
the same reason as responding fruits in our fruit-naming game. Intelli­
gence is the label of the category that includes such activities as long
division, chess playing, house design, and choreography. Those activ­
ities are all instances of intelligence. The error is treating the category
label as if it were an instance of the category.
The likely objection to this argument would go, " No, what 1 mean
by intelligence is not all those activities, but something underlying
those activities, that makes them possible, that causes them." But where
is this intelligence? What is it made of? How could it cause behavior?
Its ghostly nature derives from its being the label, rather than an
instance, of the category. The reason the logical error occurs so readily
is that the objection exemplifies a common theory about behavior,
which Ryle called the para-mechanical hypothesis.

44

Category Mistakes
The philosopher Gilbert Ryle (1900-76) also attacked mentalism, but
took a different approach from Skinner's. Whereas Skinner proposed
to exclude terms like mind, intelligence, reason, and belief from behavior
analysis, Ryle thought that the terms might be useful if we could
avoid using them illogically. The trouble with a term like intelligence is
only that people will say that Zack displays intelligent behavior and
intelligence. Whereas Skinner would regard intelligence as a mental
fiction inferred from the intelligent behavior, Ryle argued that intelli­
gence is intelligent behavior, and to consider the one to be the cause
of the other or even to consider the two to be conjoined in any way
involves a logical error, a category mistake.
If we are naming examples of fruit (a category), and offer carrot as
an instance, that is an error, a category mistake, because a carrot is not
a fruit. Category mistakes are of various types, the various ways in
which a supposed instance can fail to belong to a category to which it
is mistakenly assigned. Ryle was concerned with a particular type of
category mistake.
Suppose we are naming fruits again, and someone suggests veget­
ables. That is an error in a different way from carrot. Vegetables does
not merely belong in another, similar category; it is itself the label of
another category like fruits. It would seem even more strange in our
fruit-naming game if someone were to suggest fruits. Not only is fruits
a category label rather than a possible instance, but also it is the label
of the very category of which we are naming instances. This error of
treating fruits as if it were an instance of fruits, however, is exactly the
sort of error that Ryle considers to occur in mentalism.

45

Ryle and the Para-Mechanical Hypothesis
The para-mechanical hypothesis is the idea that terms that logically are
category labels refer to ghostly things in some ghostly space (the mind),
and that these ghostly things somehow mechanically cause behavior.
This is exactly the same idea that Skinner called mentalism. Whereas
Skinner emphasized the practical problems with mentalism - that it is
distracting and useless - Ryle emphasized the logical problems with it.
To illustrate, Ryle pointed to the concept of team spirit. When we
watch a football game and see the players shout encouragement to
one another, pat one another on the back when they make mistakes,
and hug one another when they succeed, we say they are showing
team spirit. We do not mean that some ghostly spirit is running
up and down the field with them, hovering around their heads. If a
foreigner were to ask, " 1 see them shouting, patting, and hugging, but
where is that famous team spirit?" we would think the question odd
and that the questioner failed to understand the concept. We might
explain that the shouting, patting, and hugging are the team spirit.
We would mean that those activities are instances of the category of
activities that we label team spirit. They are not the only instances; we
coul d expand the list greatly.
The foreigner's error arose because of the way we talk about team
spirit: We say the team shows it. That is why the foreigner thought it
correct to conjoin shouting, patting, hugging, and showing team spirit.

What Is Behaviorism?

Public, Private, Natural, and Fictional

It is the same error as conjoining long division, chess playing, choreo­
graphy, and showing intelligence. Just as showing team spirit is a label
for a category of behavior, so showing intelligence is a label for a cat­
egory of behavior. Doing long division and playing chess are instances
of showing intelligence. There is no ghostly intelligence, no thing,
intelligence, to be shown.
Ryle applied his argument to all sorts of mental capacities and
states that are said to be shown in behavior or to cause behavior:
Knowledge, purpose, emotion, and others. For instance, why do we
say, "Aaron loves Marcia?" He buys her flowers, writes poetry to her,
stammers and blushes in her presence, declares his love to her, and so
on. Aaron does not do those things and love Marcia or because he loves
Marcia; Aaron's doing those things is his being in love with Marcia.
We will see how Ryle's argument applies to other terms in some of
the following chapters. Although he attacked mentalism primarily on
logical grounds, his arguments and Skinner's differ mainly in emphasis:
The germs of Skinner's pragmatic objections can be found in Ryle's
writings, and the basics of Ryle's logical objections can be found in
Skinner's writings. The main disagreement between them seems to
be that, whereas Skinner wished to exclude mentalistic terms from
technical discussions of behavior, Ryle implied that they could be used
if only we remember that love, belief, expectation, attitude, and the
like are really only labels of categories of behavior.
Other philosophers criticized Ryle's arguments. They considered
them unsound on two main grounds. First, Ryle's use of "category"
seemed to imply an unacceptable open-endedness - that is, "showing
intelligence" or "being in love" might encompass an infinite num­
ber of activities - which would prevent one from specifying exactly
which actions should be taken as instances of the category. Second,
Ryle's insistence that the truth of a report of a "raw feel," such as pain,
depends entirely on ("necessitates") the presence of public activities
doesn't require that "l have a pain" just means "1 am clutching myself
and writhing." The philosopher Richard Rorty (1979), for example,
put the criticisms this way:

The last point seems incorrect because a fire's being "inside" a stove
is a clear physical relation, whereas a belief's being " inside" a person
carries no such clarity, and the other points all hinge on a mentalistic
view of categories, language, and meaning. Regardless of whether
philosophers are persuaded by these objections, behaviorists build on
Ryle's points, taking them steps further with additional concepts. In
chapter 6, when we consider the concept of stimulus control, we will
go beyond the objection about the open-endedness of categories, and
in chapter 7, when we take up verbal behavior, we will go beyond
the objection about " meaning." Right now, however, we will see how
Ryle's idea of categories may be replaced by the more concrete idea of
an activity.

46

[Ryle's argument] has been attacked on the ground that there seems no
way to fill in a description of the requisite disposition to behave without
giving infinitely long lists of possible movements and noises. It has also
been attacked on the ground that whatever "necessity" there is in the
area is not a matter of " meaning" but simply an expression of the fact
that we customarily explain certain behavior by reference to certain inner
states - so that the necessity is no more "linguistic" or " conceptual" than
that which connects the redness of the stove to the fire within. (p. 98)

47

Rachlin's Molar Behaviorism
Howard Rachlin, a contemporary behaviorist, took Ryle's argument a
step further. Since at least the 1930s, some behaviorists have suggested
that behavior cannot be understood by focusing on events of the
moment. In the nineteenth century and first half of the twentieth cen­
tury, atomistic views of mind and behavior abounded. Since the only
well-understood unit of behavior was the reflex, talk about behavior
tended to be couched in terms of stimulus and response, events that
occur in a moment, and the most important relation between events
was considered to be their momentary closeness in time, or contiguity.
Critics of this emphasis on momentary events and contiguity called
such views molecular and proposed instead views that they called
molar. Molar thinkers argue that molecular views of behavior fall short,
for two reasons. First, present behavior depends not only on present
events, but on many past events. These past events affect behavior
as an aggregate, not as momentary happenings. The reason I avoid
eating rich food today is that I ate rich food many times in the past
and gained weight; none of this happened at any particular moment
in time. Second, behavior cannot occur in a moment; no matter how
brief, it always takes some time. Brushing my teeth may be a single
event, but it takes me a while. If I put together all the activities of my
day, they must add up to 24 hours.
Rachlin saw in Ryle's ideas a justification and an extension of this
second tenet of molarism, that the units of behavior (i.e., activities)
extend through time. Aaron's loving Marcia, our example above, occurs
at no particular time because it is a whole aggregate of activities that
occur at different times. It would seem absurd to say that Aaron does
not love Marcia at this moment because he is working instead of

What Is Behaviorism?

Public. Private, Natural. and Fictional

giving her flowers, paying her compliments, or any of the other activ­
ities that comprise loving Marcia. It seems perfectly reasonable to say
that Aaron loves Marcia now and has done so for years, even though
he has been spending most of that time working and sleeping. The
common "solution" to this problem of Aaron loving Marcia all the
time and yet not showing love for Marcia all the time is the para­
mechanical hypothesis; invent a ghostly love-thing, a mental fiction,
that is there all the time to cause Aaron's loving behavior when it
occurs and bridge the time gaps in between. However attractive this
idea might seem, we have seen that it is no real solution, because it is
confusing and uneconomical (Skinner) and it fails logically (Ryle).
According to the molar view, what matters about Aaron's love is
how often his loving activities occur. Aaron's loving Marcia and Aaron's
showing love for Marcia are really just two labels for the same aggreg­
ate of activities. It makes sense to say that Aaron has loved Marcia for
years because over those years loving activities have occurred with
relatively high frequency. Aaron has shown, not some ghostly inner
mental love, but a high rate of loving activities. These activities need ·
not be the only things he does; they just need to occur often enough.
Indeed, their rate is crucial. If Aaron only telephoned Marcia once a
month and only brought her flowers once a year, she might well doubt
his sincerity, particularly if he is calling Dolores every day and giving
her flowers twice a week. If Aaron declares that he loves Marcia
now and forever, he is predicting that his loving activities will go on
occurring at a high frequency.
Activities are episodic. Aaron may work for a while, then talk on
the telephone to Marcia for a while, then work a while, then day­
dream about Marcia, then eat lunch, and then work some more. The
talking to Marcia and daydreaming about Marcia are episodes of
loving Marcia. They are parts of the extended activity of loving
Marcia. During the period we are discussing, Aaron spends some time
working, some time maintaining his health (eating), and some time
loving Marcia. As shorthand for an episode of an activity we will use
the word action. Aaron alternates loving actions with other actions
(e.g., episodes of working) throughout the day. That is what makes us
say that Aaron loves Marcia.
Rachlin's argument applies to all terms that seem to refer to inner
causes of behavior, whether states of mind like love and anger or
behavioral dispositions like intentions and beliefs. He illustrated with
a discussion of what it means to be in pain (Rachlin, 1985). As with
love, being in pain is the same as showing pain and engaging in
activities that make up the activity of being in pain - grimacing, groan­
ing, clutching oneself, screaming, rolling around, limping, and so on.

As with love, whether or not someone is said to be in pain depends
only on how often such activities occur and in what contexts they
occur. If a person only groans once a week or only groans when his
mother is in the room, then we are inclined to conclude that he is
faking. An actor may completely convince us that he is in pain on the
stage, but when we see him after the play laughing and chatting, we
say he was only acting. We assert confidently that someone is in pain
only if pain-behavior occurs at a consistent, high rate. If being in pain
is just showing pain-behavior often and in all circumstances, just as
with being in love, then there is no ghostly inner mental pain, just as
there was no ghostly inner mental love. In other words, there is no
thing, pain, that is sensed. Rather, sensing pain or being in pain is itself
a whole activity or aggregate of activities.
An objection arises. Perhaps there is no ghostly inner mental love,
but pain in no way seems ghostly. Rather, it seems to be a sensation,
a real private event - what philosophers call a "raw feel." Rachlin's
response to this is best understood from his answer to the objection
worded, "But I can feel pain and not show it."
Rachlin argues that it is impossible to feel pain and not show it
because to feel pain is to show it. One philosopher tried to refute
Rachlin's whole argument by relating that for years he had severe
headaches without ever letting on to anyone about them. Rachlin's
reply was, " If so . . . his parents, his doctor, his closest friends, and his
spouse and children (if any) must, to this day, still not know about
those headaches. Does anyone want to bet?" Although this might seem
facetious, the serious point is that one cannot be in pain without show­
ing it, either to others or to oneself. Rachlin's argument only seems
counter to experience as long as one insists that it is possible to be in
pain and show it to no one. Alone in my room, I may be in pain and
get over it before anyone sees me. Was I not in pain? I was, if I showed
it, but the whole episode was private only in the sense that no other
person happened to be present; had another person been there, that
person would also have said that I was in pain. My way of knowing
that I have a headache is the same as your way of knowing that I have
a hea dache: I frown, groan, shut my eyes, complain, and take aspirin.
If I did none of those things, I would be no more inclined to say I had
a headache than you would be.
Paradoxical though it might seem, Rachlin's idea that pain consists
of public behavior rather than private experience has plenty of evid­
ence to back it up. In particular, verbally reporting pain and other
pain-behavior depend greatly on circumstances. Many of us have had
injuries that should have been painful but were not because we were
distracted. Having twisted an ankle, an athlete may go on running

and report that the ankle began to hurt after the race. The same injury
under nonrace circumstances would have resulted in immediately
"feeling pain." Research on pain has produced many examples like
this. Although childbirth is considered painful in our culture, anthro­
pologists have described cultures in which women show no signs of
pain, give birth while working in the fields, and go on working as
soon as the baby is born, while the father lies at home in bed and
groans and shows every sign of being in intense pain. A particularly
striking example was reported by Henry K. Beecher, an anesthesiologist
who compared the behavior of wounded soldiers in a World War II
combat hospital with the behavior of civilians who were undergoing
surgery that involved wounds similar to the soldiers' wounds. He
found that whereas only about one third of the soldiers complained
of pain enough to receive morphine, four out of five of the civilian
surgery patients did so. Although the soldiers reported feeling little or
no pain whereas the civilians reported severe pain, Beecher observed
that the difference was not that the soldiers were insensitive to painful
stimuli, because they complained as much as anyone when a vein ·
puncture was botched. Beecher concluded:

Rachlin, neither love nor pain need exist as a private thing, because
in practice what people say about themselves or others always relies
most heavily on public behavior. In this molar perspective, it can truly
be said that the way I know myself is the same way that others know
me. We will explore this further in chapter 6.
Rachlin's denial of private events might seem like a return to
methodological behaviorism, but it is not. Both methodological beha­
viorists and Rachlin advocate the study of public events, but for dif­
ferent reasons. Methodological behaviorists regard public events as
objective and rule out of bounds mental things and events because
they are subjective. Approaching behavior with a molecular view, they
hoped to predict momentary acts. Rachlin never raises the objective­
subjective distinction and never rules out mental things and events.
Instead, he asserts that one can study mental things and events,
because the terms (pain, love, self-esteem, and so on) that supposedly
refer to them are really labels for molar activities. Therefore, we
study mental things and events by studying the public events that
go into the activities so labeled. Rachlin parts with methodological
behaviorism and aligns himself with radical behaviorism on two
grounds: anti-dualism and pragmatism. Like any radical behaviorist,
he denies the existence of mental fictions, and especially mental causes
of behavior. Since he never raises the subjective-objective distinction,
instead measuring the truth of his view by its explanatory power
(usefulness), his ideas belong in the tradition of pragmatism rather
than realism. He need neither deny nor affirm the existence of private
events, because the molar activities that people talk about always
include many public actions. Indeed, people would not talk about
them if they did not - but that is a topic for a discussion of verbal
behavior. (See chapter 7.)

There is no simple direct relationship between the wound per se and
the pain experienced. The pain is in very large part determined by
other factors, and of great importance here is the significance of the
wound . . . In the wounded soldier [the response to injury] was relief,
thankfulness at his escape alive from the battlefield, even euphoria;
to the civilian, his major surgery was a depressing, calamitous event.
(Quoted by Melzack, 1961, pp. 42-3)

These observations support Rachlin's view, because instead of
the same trauma producing the same pain, as the para-mechanical
hypothesis would require, the whole activity of being in pain, includ­
ing the report of feeling pain, depends on circumstances. Even though
our apparent inner experience of pain seems compelling, clinical and
experimental evidence support the idea that being in pain, like being
in love, or any other mental state, consists of public behavior.
With such a view, Rachlin lays much less emphasis on private
events than Skinner. It becomes a matter of little importance for Rachlin
whether private events really occur or not, because his view de- ·
emphasizes momentary events and isolated actions in general, whether
public or private. Aaron's being in love with Marcia might include his
thinking about her, but if none of the public activities in the category
occur, both Marcia and Aaron should doubt Aaron's sincerity. For

51

Private Events
For Skinner, private events are natural and like public events in all
important respects. Even if thoughts are natural events and may be
said sometimes to affect behavior, still they never cause behavior in
the sense of originating it. Although the origins of behavior lie in the
present and past environment, private events figure importantly in
Skinner's analysis of certain types of behavior, particularly self-reports,
which we will consider now and in chapter 6, and problem-solving,
Which we will take up in chapter 8.

52

What Is Behaviorism?

Private Behavior
Since private events are assigned to the person, rather than to the
environment, they are best understood as behavioral events. Broadly
speaking, there are two kinds: thinking events and sensing events.
Thinking, for the present discussion, is speaking privately. This
may seem too narrow, because thinking is used in many other ways
in everyday talk. "I am thinking of going to a movie" means I am
inclined, or likely, to go to a movie. "I am thinking of a painting I once
saw" means I am imagining the painting, and is best understood as a
sensing event.
Thinking is usefully set apart from sensing events, because thoughts
have a relationship to public speech that sensing events do not. A
thought may be stated publicly or privately (Skinner used the words
overt and covert). I may say to myself aloud, I wonder what will happen
if I push this button, or I may whisper it to myself, or I may think it
privately. These events are all much the same; the first two might be '
overheard, whereas the third cannot be. Sensing events, however, have
no such public counterparts. The public parts of smelling a skunk
(holding one's nose and talking about the smell) differ in form from
whatever private sensing might be involved.
Sensing events are best understood in contrast with the usual view
of sensation and perception, which Skinner calls "copy theory." Some
ancient Greek philosophers puzzling as to how it was possible to
see objects at a distance thought that the objects must send copies
of themselves to our eyes. If I see a tree across the road from me, it
must be because the tree sends little copies of itself to my eyes. The
modern view is similar, except now we say that the tree reflects light,
which passes through the pupils of my eyes to form images on the
membranes at the rear of my eyeballs. These images substitute for the
Greek copies.
This notion may be useful in understanding some things about the
eyes, but it in no way explains seeing. The problem of how the tree is
seen is now replaced by the problem of how the tree's copy is seen.
Copy theory has all the defects of mentalism. The appearance of an
explanation - you see the tree because you have a copy of it in your
eye or in your brain - distracts us from our attempt to understand
what seeing is. The copy is superfluous, because the question remains
the same whether we ask about seeing the tree or seeing the copy:
What is it to see something? In particular, copy theory fails to explain
why seeing is selective. Not all objects that reflect light to our eyes are
seen. Why do I see the tree and not the road? How is it possible for

Public, Private, Natural, and Fictional

53

one person to point something out to another, to "get" you to see
something? How is it possible for someone to look right at a sign and
yet not see it?
To the radical behaviorist, sensing and perceiving are behavioral
events, activities. The thing that is seen, heard, smelled, felt, or tasted
is a quality of the event - that is, part of the definition of the event.
Seeing a wolf is qualitatively different from seeing a bear. The two
events have much in common - both are episodes of seeing, rather
than hearing or walking - but they also differ. They are different
activities, just as walking to the store differs from walking to the bank.
The goal or object of walking (store or bank) is part of the definition
of the activity. If I say, It's a nice day on one occasion and, There's a
tiger behind you on another, both are episodes of speaking, but the
two actions differ in the same way as the two actions of walking; the
nice day and the tiger are part of the definition of the action. Just as
one cannot walk without walking somewhere and talk without saying
something, one cannot see without seeing something. The somewheres
and the somethings differentiate among different acts of walking,
talking, and seeing, but not as attachments to them. They are different
actions, not the same action applied to different things.
That the goal or object of a sensing event is a quality of the event
can be seen more clearly when we talk about other senses than vision.
In such talk we rarely fall prey to copy theory. If I hear a violin play­
ing, someone would rarely assert that my activity of hearing somehow
fastens onto the sound of the violin. The sound is part of the activity,
the result of the activity, perhaps. Hearing a violin and hearing an
oboe are different activities, not the same activity applied to different
sounds. An ancient Zen Buddhist puzzle goes, "If a tree falls in the
forest, and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound?" The
behaviorist's answer is no, because a sound exists only as part of an
action of hearing. In the same way that hearing a violin differs from
hearing an oboe, so seeing a bear differs from seeing a wolf.
The relationship between seeing and the thing seen becomes clearer
still when we examine instances of what Skinner called "seeing with­
out a thing seen." If I dream of a wolf, is a wolf present? If I imagine
my childhood home, is my home there? Probably one reason copy
theory exists is to try to explain such instances. Supposedly if I am
seeing, something must be there to see; since there is neither a wolf
nor a house, a copy must be held up somehow to my vision (not to my
eyes!). Copy theory used this way is a form of mentalism; the appar­
ent explanation is no explanation at all. Where is the ghostly mental
copy, what is it made of, and how can it be seen? Whereas before we
had an action of seeing to explain, now we have the same action plus

54

What Is Behaviorism?

a mysterious copy with a mysterious relationship to the action. The
alternative is to consider seeing a wolf with eyes closed to resemble
seeing a wolf with eyes open. The two activities differ - we can
usually tell them apart - but they have much in common. This leaves
unanswered such questions as " How do I dream and imagine things
I have never actually seen?" and "ls it possible to practice imagina­
tion?" Viewing dreaming and imagining as activities, however, allows
these questions to be framed for scientific study more effectively than
they could be by copy theory.
Copy theory attempts to explain dreaming and imagining by the
idea that copies are stored in and retrieved from memory. Questions
about recollection become questions about ghostly mental processes
of encoding, storage, and retrieval. If when I imagine my childhood
home I see my father there, supposedly that is because the two copies
are somehow linked together in memory. If when someone says, "Think
of birds," I think of sparrows, finches, and ostriches, supposedly that
is because copies of those things are linked in some way in memory.
In contrast, the behavior-analytic view points to facts of life. When I '
was a child, seeing my childhood home, I saw my father, too. When I
heard about birds, I often heard about sparrows, finches, and ostriches.
If these things are linked, it is not in memory, but in time and place.
Recollection is repetition. When I recall a visit to the ocean, I resee
the sky, water, and sand, rehear the waves, and resmell the sea air.
Those actions of imagining differ from the original actions of seeing,
hearing, and smelling, but they are similar also. Much of our behavior
is repeated every day. I comb my hair every morning. Does it help to
understand how or why I do that to say that somewhere inside me
must be a memory of hair combing?
Many psychologists cling to the idea that if an activity repeats, it
must somehow be represented inside the person, presumably in the
brain. When faced with the defects of representations as copies, they
often insist that the representation is just the workings of the brain. By
such reasoning, when I start my car each morning, the running engine
must be represented in the resting engine. Someday, neurophysiologists
may have something to say about the brain mechanisms by which
activities recur. In the meantime, we can continue to expand our
understanding of seeing and reseeing as activities.
Sensory activities are modified by experience; they are subject to .
learning. First-year medical students see a brain differently from their
instructors. Once upon a time, the instructors saw as little as the
students; someday the students will see as much as their instructors.
We learn to pick things out of a landscape or a symphony. If I say to
you, "See that barn across the fields" or " Listen to the oboe," you see

Figure 3 . 1 : Doodles like these illustrate that seeing is behavior and,

or hear something that you didn't a moment ago. Figure 3.1 shows
two doodles. If you have never seen them before, they look like collec­
tions of lines. (If you have seen them before, then remember the first
time you saw them.) Now I tell you that the top one shows a bear
climbing a tree (it's on the other side), and the bottom one shows a
soldier and his dog going behind a fence. You see them differently.
Your behavior has changed as a result of reading these words. After
we take up discrimination and stimulus control in chapters 6 and 7,

What Is Behaviorism?

you will understand better how this behavioral change could be called
discriminated seeing.

I could tell you in some detail. I can do it to some extent even if you
never prompted me. To the extent that I can talk about them, people
will say my actions are conscious. My actions of driving or walking
may be conscious or unconscious, depending on whether I can tell
someone else about them. Even actions of speaking may be designated
conscious or unconscious, depending on whether the speaker can
repeat what he or she said. How often people say things and a minute
later deny having said them! We say, "It was said unconsciously."
Like other activities, seeing and other sensing may be conscious or
unconscious, depending on whether the person talks about them. If
a police officer stops my car and asks me, "Didn't you see that stop
sign?" I could honestly answer no, because, even if I looked in its
direction, I might have failed to see the sign, just as when you first
looked at the doodles in figure 3.1 you failed to see the bear and the
soldier. If the officer asks me, "Do you see the sign now?" I will look
and say yes. Both answers are reports on behavior: the first a report
on the absence of an event, and the second a report on the occurrence
of an event. Although in Skinner's view the event being reported on is
private, both Rachlin and Skinner would agree that reporting on one's
private activities is the same as reporting on one's public activities.
We learn to talk about what we see, hear, smell, and think in the same
way as we learn to talk about what we eat, where we go, and what we
say. Self-knowledge consists of such talk. In chapter 7, we will see that
this talk is verbal behavior, a social product, under control of stimuli
that are both public and private.
Rachlin shares with Skinner the general view that self-knowledge
can be understood as a type of behavior, but because he regards actions
as parts of more extended activities, he assigns private actions a much
lesser role in self-knowledge. To Rachlin, seeing a robin is an activity,
just as walking to the store might be. Just as walking to the store includes
such behavior as walking in a certain direction, talking about walking
to the store, and afterwards bringing home a purchase, so seeing a
robin includes such behavior as looking in its direction, pointing at it,
talking about it, and remarking when it is gone. Some of the behavior
included in seeing a robin might be saying, " Look, there's a robin" or
or see a robin" or responding "Yes" when someone else asks whether
r see the robin. In the molar view, these are not reports on private
events; they are simply parts of the (public) activity seeing a robin.
Rachlin's discussion of feeling pain touches on a phenomenon that
most people would consider a private sensing event. The molar view
of feeling pain resembles the molar view of seeing a robin. Feeling
pain in the leg includes such behavior as pointing to it, clutching it,
limping, and talking about it. Saying "My leg hurts" is not reporting

56

Self- Knowledge and Consciousness
The word conscious is used in a variety of ways. " Having conscious­
ness" appears to be the same as "being conscious," because conscious­
ness is not a thing but a property. A person may be said to have
consciousness or to have lost it, to be conscious or unconscious; both
contrasts refer to the same possibilities. Whether we call a person con­
scious or unconscious depends on what the person does, particularly
in response to environmental events like questions and pinpricks. From
time to time someone asks whether nonhuman animals are conscious
or not. The answer to the question depends on what the animal does
and what we will accept as evidence of consciousness. Some acts are
said to be conscious, others not. Jurors frequently have to judge whether
a person decided to commit a crime consciously or not.
Many different criteria for making judgments about consciousness
have been proposed, but no consensus exists about what it means for
a person or an action to be conscious. Debate continues about whether
dogs and bats are conscious. When debate is endless, the scientist, as
pragmatist, begins to suspect that the fault lies less with the answers
than with the question itself.
The behaviorist may be interested in trying to understand when
people are inclined to use the word conscious, but the notion is of
no use for the scientific understanding of behavior. The vagueness
and uselessness of the idea of consciousness derives from its ties to
Skinner's homunculus and Ryle's para-mechanical hypothesis. Con­
sciousness belongs to the little person or autonomous self inside, who
looks out at the external world through the senses or looks within the
inner world of the mind and is thus conscious of both worlds. Call
into question this view of inner world, outer world, inner self, and
mind, and you call into question the notion of consciousness, because
the notion of consciousness hardly has meaning apart from this view.
Inquiring what makes people use phrases such as " losing conscious­
ness" and "being conscious" of something, the behaviorist asks how
people learn such talk or what events occasion such talk. Although
social groups vary considerably one to another, everyone seems to
agree on one type of evidence: If people can talk about their behavior,
then they are considered to be conscious and conscious of it. I cannot
usually tell you about all the acts involved in my driving to work they are unconscious - but if you specifically asked me to notice, then

57

on a private event; it is simply part of the activity of feeling pain in the
leg. As far as Rachlin is concerned, the private event of pain remains
outside the discussion. It is not only irrelevant but might not even
exist. If a person complains of pain in the leg, and does so convin­
cingly, we behave the same way whether the pain exists or not. Only
later might we learn that the person was faking; perhaps the pain
vanishes too suddenly or the person limps on the wrong leg. The
same would be true of seeing or hearing. In the movie The Heart Is a
Lonely Hun ter, a deaf man pretends to be enjoying music by moving
his body as if he were conducting an orchestra. His performance is
convincing, but when the record stops and he continues, his com­
panion realizes he was faking. Had he stopped when the record
stopped, she would presumably have continued to regard him as
having heard the music. Sooner or later, he was bound to slip up, but
if a deaf person could fake perfectly, to all intents and purposes that
person would be hearing, because faking perfectly would mean that
no one knows the difference.
Someone might object that even if a deaf person fooled everyone
around him, he himself would know he was faking. If he succeeded
in all instances, however, how could he know? For all he knows, this
behavior is hearing. Only if his own behavior differed from other
people's behavior could he himself know he was faking. Suppose a
hearing person listening to music fakes enjoyment. If he does all
the right things, why should he not believe that he really enjoys it?
The only clue to him or to others would be a difference between
his behavior and the behavior of those who are said really to enjoy
music. They smile, relax, resist being interrupted, and talk about the
music afterward. Do I enjoy the music less because I do not talk about
it afterward? Perhaps. Just as no private enjoyment need enter the
discussion, so, in the molar view, no private hearing need enter the
discussion.

which would lead to a satisfactory scientific explanation. Mentalism
is unsatisfactory because it is uneconomical (Skinner) and logically
fallacious (Ryle).
Second, in a science of behavior, everyday mentalistic terms like
believe, expect, and intend either must be avoided or carefully rede­
fined. The extent to which behavior analysts should do one or the
other remains to be seen. We will see in subsequent chapters that
some terms can be redefined fairly well, whereas others seem too
foreign to be worth redefining. Some new terms, invented for behavior
analysis, seem especially helpful.
Third, private events, if they need to be spoken of at all, are natural
and share all the properties of public behavior. Even if they are to be
spoken of, their origins lie in the environment, just like other behavior;
behavior never originates in private events. Whereas Skinner gives
them a role in situations involving talking about private behavior
(self-knowledge; chapters 6 and 7), molar behaviorists like Rachlin
circumvent the need to give private events any explanatory role at all
by conceiving of behavior as organized into activities that occur over
extended periods of time. Such extended activities sometimes include,
among other parts, talking about private events.

58

Summary
Although radical behaviorists hold a variety of views on many topics,
they generally agree on the following basic points.
First, the mentalistic explanations of behavior that occur in every­
day talk have no place in a science. Mental causes of behavior are
fictional. The origins of behavior lie in heredity and in the environ­
ment, present and past. Because mental fictions give the appearance of
explanations, they tend to impede inquiry into environmental origins,

To be clear and convincing about one's criticism of someone else's
view, one must offer an alternative view that would be acceptable. To
help see what is wrong with conventional mentalistic views of behavior,
we need to consider explanations that might be scientifically acceptable.
In chapters 4 through 8 we will take up some basic concepts in behavior
analysis and use them to suggest alternatives to unscientific mentalistic
notions.
A warning is in order, however. Like all scientific explanations, the
ones that we will take up are considered by scientists to be tentative,
open to dispute and to change. Any of these explanations may come
to be considered incorrect in the future or may be disbelieved by some
behavior analysts even today.
For our purposes, the possibility that a particular scientific explana­
tion may eventually be discarded is unimportant. We need only to
see that scientific explanations of behavior are possible. As behavior
analysis moves ahead, the explanations accepted will change as new
ones are devised. We need only to see, as an alternative to mentalism,
what sort of explanation is scientifically acceptable.

Chapter 4

Evolutionary Theory and
Reinforcement

Modern evolutionary theory provides a powerful framework within
which to talk about behavior. Indeed it no longer seems possible to
discuss behavior outside this context because biologists since Darwin
have increasingly claimed behavior as part of their subject matter.
In keeping with the assumption of continuity of species (chapter I),
their attention has turned more and more to human behavior as well.
Even more than in Watson's time, psychologists who ignore evolu­
tionary theory today risk isolation from the mainstream of scientific
development.
Our concerns with evolutionary theory in this chapter are twofold.
First, the evolutionary history or phylogeny of any species - including
our own - can help us understand its behavior. Most of the genes an
individual inherits have been selected across many generations because
they promote behavior that makes for successful interaction with the
environment and reproduction. Second, evolutionary theory represents
a type of explanation that is unusual among the sciences. Scientific
explanations usually appeal to mechanism, or the way things are
arranged at a certain time. The type exemplified by evolutionary theory,
which we will call historical explanation, is central to behavior analysis
because the scientifically acceptable alternative to mentalism is his­
torical explanation.

Evolutionary History
When we talk about the phylogeny of a species, we are talking about
no particular event, but a series or history of events over a long period.
Physics offers a different sort of answer to the question "Why does the

64

sun rise in the morning?" than biology offers to the question "Why
do giraffes have long necks?" The explanation about the sun requires
reference only to events occurring right at the moment - the rotation of
the earth at the time of sunrise. The explanation about giraffes' necks
requires reference to the births, lives, and deaths of countless giraffes
and giraffe ancestors over many millions of years.
Darwin's great contribution was to see that a relatively simple
mechanism could help explain why phylogeny followed the particular
course that it did. The history of giraffes' necks, Darwin saw, is more
than a sequence of changes; it is a history of selection. What does
the selecting? Not an omnipotent Creator, not Mother Nature, not the
giraffes, but a natural, mechanical process: natural selection.

Natural Selection
Within any population of organisms, individuals vary. They vary partly
because of environmental factors (e.g., nutrition), and also because of
genetic inheritance. Among the giraffe ancestors that lived in what is
now the Serengeti Plain, for instance, variation in genes meant that
some had shorter necks and some had longer necks. As the climate
gradually changed, however, new, taller types of vegetation became
more frequent. The giraffe ancestors that had longer necks, being able
to reach higher, got a little more to eat, on the average. As a result,
they were a little healthier, resisted disease a little better, evaded
predators a little better - on the average. Any one individual with a
longer neck may have died without offspring, but on the average
longer-necked individuals produced more offspring, which tended on
the average to survive a little better and produce more offspring. As
longer necks became frequent, new genetic combinations occurred,
with the result that some of these offspring had still longer necks than
those before, and they did still better. As the longer-necked giraffes
continued to outreproduce the shorter-necked ones, the population
consisted more and more of longer-necked individuals, and the average
neck length of the whole population grew.
Figure 4.1 diagrams the process. The horizontal axis represents neck
length, increasing from left to right. The vertical axis represents the
relative frequency of various neck lengths in the population of giraffes
or giraffe ancestors. Curve 1 shows the variation in short-necked giraffe
ancestors. As selection proceeds, the distribution shifts to the right
(curve 2), indicating that neck length, while continuing to vary, got
longer on the average. Curve 3 shows variation in present-day giraffes,
a stable frequency distribution that no longer shifts toward longer necks.

Figure 4. 1 :

Evolution by natural selection.

For such a process of selection, three conditions must be met.
First, whatever environmental factor makes having a longer neck
advantageous (in our example, the tall vegetation) must remain present.
Second, the variation in neck length must reflect, at least in part, genetic
variation. Longer-necked individuals must tend to have more longer­
necked than shorter-necked offspring. If, for example, all the variation
in neck length were due to variation in diet, with no underlying vari­
ation in genes - the individuals that ate better had longer necks, instead
of the other way around - selection would be impossible because
generation after generation the same variation in diet and neck length
would be repeated. Third, the different types must compete. Since an
area's resources can support only a certain sized population of giraffes,
and reproduction results in more giraffes than can survive, some
offspring must die. The successful offspring will survive into the next
generation to produce their own offspring.
These three factors are incorporated into the concept of fitness. The
fitness of a genetic variant (a genotype) is its tendency to increase from
one generation to the next relative to the other genotypes in the popu­
lation. Any one genotype, even a short-necked one, could do well by
itself, but in competition with others its fitness might be low. The
greater the fitness of a genotype, the more that genotype will tend
to predominate as generation succeeds generation. The vertical axis
going downward in figure 4.1 represents the fitness of the genotypes
underlying the various neck lengths. The shaded curve shows how
fitness varies with neck length. It remains the same throughout the

A Scientific Model of Behavior

selection process, because it represents the constant factors in the
environment (the vegetation) that link neck length to reproductive
success. Its maximum is at the vertical broken line, the same line that
indicates the average neck length of today's giraffes. Once the average
genotype in a population reaches the maximum fitness, the distribution
of genotypes in the population stabilizes.
Once the population stabilizes, only the directional shift ceases;
selection continues, selection that keeps the population stable. The
fitness curve in figure 4.1 passes through a maximum because too long
a neck is a disadvantage. Birth complications and the strain on the heart
of pumping blood to a great height, for example, might set an upper
limit on fitness. Since the fitness curve passes through a maximum,
selection will go against deviations from the maximum (the average of
the population) in both directions.
Darwin himself, and many biologists since, recognized that behavior
plays a central role in evolution. Selection occurs because individuals
interact with their environment. Much of that interaction is behavior.
In our example, giraffes have long necks because they eat. Turtles
have shells because drawing into them affords protection. Reproduc­
tion, the key to the whole process, cannot occur without behavior such
as courting, mating, and caring for young.
Those individuals that behave more effectively enjoy a higher
reproductive success. The fitness of a genotype depends on its pro­
ducing individuals that behave better than others - eating more,
running faster, feeding offspring more, building a better nest, and so
on. Insofar as such behavior is affected by genotype, natural selection
acts to change it and to stabilize it.

reproduction. Sneezing, blinking, shivering, release of adrenalin in
danger, and sexual arousal are examples. Individuals in which these
reflexes were strong tended to survive and reproduce better than indi­
viduals in which they were weak or nonexistent. In figure 4.1, if we
substituted force of sneeze reflex or readiness of penile erection instead
of neck length, we can imagine a similar history of selection. The fitness
curve would pass through a maximum, because too weak a sneeze is
too little protection and too slow an erection means fewer offspring,
but too strong a sneeze would be damaging and too swift an erection
would be an obstruction (not to mention a social problem). Over many
generations, genotypes promoting a stronger reflex would tend to
reproduce more frequently on the average (frequency distributions 1
and 2), until the maximum fitness arrived (frequency distribution 3).

Reflexes and Fixed Action Patterns

Reflexes
Some behavioral traits are as much characteristics of a species as are
anatomical traits. The simplest of these are called reflexes, because the
earliest theory about them was that the bodily effect produced by a
stimulus - an environmental event stimulating sense organs - was
reflected by the nervous system into a response - an action. If your
nose is tickled, you sneeze. If you are poked in the eye, you blink. If
you are cold, you shiver. The tickle, poke, and cold are stimuli; the
sneezing, blinking, and shivering are responses.
Reflexes are a product of natural selection. They invariably seem
to involve maintaining health, promoting survival, or furthering

67

Fixed action patterns
More complex patterns of behavior also can enter into fixed relations
to environmental events and be characteristic of a species. When a
parent herring gull arrives at the nest, the chicks peck at a spot on its
beak, and the parent responds by depositing food on the ground. In
other species of birds, the chicks open their mouths wide and gape,
and the parent puts the food into the open mouth. When a female
stickleback (a small fish) with eggs enters a male's territory, the male
begins a series of movements around her, and she responds by
approaching the male's nest. Such complex behavioral reactions are
known as fixed action patterns - the chicks' pecking and gaping, the
parent's regurgitating food, and the male stickleback's courtship
"dance" are examples. The environmental events that trigger fixed
action patterns are known as sign stimuli or releasers - the parent bird,
the blows on the beak, the wide-open mouth, the female stickleback's
egg-laden belly. As with reflexes, these behavioral reactions may be
seen as important to fitness and, hence, as products of a history of
natural selection. As with reflexes, those individuals in which fixed
action patterns are too weak or too strong have less fit genotypes.
Although releasers and fixed action patterns may seem more complex
than the stimuli and responses in reflexes, no clear dividing line separ­
ates the two types of reaction. Both can be considered relationships
between an environmental event (stimulus) and an action (response).
Both are considered characteristic of a species because they are highly
reliable traits, as reliable as a giraffe's neck or a leopard's spots. Being
so reliable, they are considered built-in, the result of genotype, and
not learned.

68

A Scientific Model of Behavior

Reflexes and fixed action patterns are reactions that enhance fit­
ness by being available immediately when they are needed. When the
silhouette of a hawk passes overhead, a baby quail crouches and freezes.
If this reaction depended on experience with hawks, few quail babies
would survive to reproduce. The pattern may be subject to refinement
- gull chicks improve in their accuracy of pecking at the parent's beak,
and the young vervet monkey's single alarm call eventually differenti­
ates into distinct alarm calls to an eagle, a leopard, and a snake - but its
great initial reliability derives from a history of selection for such reli­
ability. The fitness of genotypes requiring that such patterns be learned
from scratch would be less than genotypes that built in the basic form.
As with neck length or coloration, reflexes and fixed action patterns
were selected over a long period of time in which the environment
remained stable enough to maintain an advantage to those individuals
that possessed the right behavior. The reflexes and fixed action patterns
we see today were selected by the environment of the past. Although
they enhanced fitness in the past, nothing guarantees that they continue
to enhance fitness in the present; if the environment changed recently,
selection would have had no chance to change the built-in behavior
patterns.
Do human beings possess such unlearned patterns? Among all
species, ours seems to be the most dependent on learning. It would be
a mistake, however, to imagine that human behavior is entirely learned.
We have many reflexes: coughing and sneezing, startle, blinking,
pupillary dilation, salivation, glandular secretion, and so on. What
about fixed action patterns? These are hard to recognize in humans
because they are so modified by later learning (as with the gull chicks
and the young vervet monkeys). Some can be recognized because they
occur universally. One fixed action pattern is the smile, for example even people blind since birth smile. Another is the eyebrow flash
of greeting: when one person sincerely greets another the eyebrows
momentarily rise. Neither person is usually aware of the response, but
it produces a feeling of welcome for the greeted person (Eibl-Eibesfeldt,
1975). It should come as no surprise that humans possess fixed action
patterns, even though they are modified or suppressed by cultural
training. Indeed, we could hardly learn all the complex patterns we do
without an elaborate base of built-in initial tendencies.

Respondent conditioning
One simple type of learning that occurs with reflexes and fixed action
patterns is classical or respondent conditioning. It is called conditioning

Evolutionary Theory and Reinforcement

69

because its discoverer, 1. P. Pavlov, used the term conditional reflex to
describe the result of the learning; he thought a new reflex was learned
that was conditional upon experience. Pavlov studied a variety of
reflexes, but his best-known research focused on responses to food.
He found that when a stimulus such as a tone or light regularly
precedes feeding, behavior in the presence of the stimulus changes.
A dog begins after a number of tone-food pairings to salivate and
secrete digestive juices in the stomach in the presence of the tone by
itself. If Zack begins to salivate when he sees the roast turkey brought
in to dinner on Thanksgiving, it seems clear that he was not born
having that reaction; he salivates because in the past such events pre­
ceded eating. If Zack had grown up in an orthodox Hindu home in
India, vegetarian from birth, it is unlikely that the sight of a roasted
turkey would make him salivate. If, having grown up in the United
States, he were to visit an Indian home, he might fail to salivate at
some of the food served for dinner there.
The same conditioning that governs simple reflex reactions also
governs fixed action patterns. Researchers after Pavlov found that in
any situation in which eating has occurred often in the past, all behavior
related to food, not just salivation, becomes more likely. Dogs bark
and wag their tails, behavior that accompanies group feeding in wild
dogs. As the time of feeding draws near, pigeons become likely to
peck at almost anything - a light, the floor, the air, or another pigeon
- until food is available to peck at.
Behavior analysts debate the best way to talk about such phenomena.
The older way, derived from Pavlov's idea of conditional reflexes,
speaks of responses elicited by stimuli, suggesting a one-to-one causal
relation. This may work for reflex reactions like salivation, but many
researchers find it inadequate when applied to the variety of behavior
that becomes likely around feeding. To talk about the whole cluster of
food-related behavior, the term induce was introduced (Segal, 1972).
Repeated feeding following a tone induces food-related behavior in the
presence of the tone. We may say also that, backed up by the repeated
feeding, the tone induces the food-related behavior. For a dog, this
. means that salivation, barking, and tail-wagging all become likely when
the tone is on.
What is true of food is true of other phylogenetically important
events. Situations that precede mating induce sexual arousal, a whole
cluster of reflexes and fixed action patterns that varies widely from
species to species. For humans, it entails changes in heart rate, blood
flow, and glandular secretion.
Situations that precede danger induce a variety of aggressive and
defensive behavior. A rat that is given electric shocks in the presence

A Scientific Model of Behavior

Evolutionary Theory and Reinforcement

of another rat attacks the other rat. Similarly, people in pain often
become aggressive, and any situation in which pain has occurred in
the past induces aggressive behavior. How many doctors, dentists,
and nurses have had to wrestle with unwilling patients before any
pain was ever actually inflicted! Such situations induce a host of reflex
reactions and fixed action patterns varying from one species to another.
Some of this behavior has more to do with escape than with aggres­
sion. Creatures may become very likely to run in situations that signal
danger. Sometimes, when a situation includes pain that in the past
has been inescapable, the signs of danger induce extreme passivity, a
phenomenon known as learned helplessness and sometimes speculated
to resemble clinical depression in humans.
The debate over what all this means and how best to talk about it
continues, but it need not detain us here. For our purposes, it is enough
to note that a history of natural selection can have at least two sorts of
results. First, it can ensure that events important to fitness, such as
food, a mate, or a predator, reliably produce behavioral reactions,
both simple reflexes and fixed action patterns. Second, it can ensure
the susceptibility of a species to respondent conditioning. Zack may
not come into the world salivating at roast turkey, but he does come
in so constructed that he may learn this reaction if he grows up in the
United States. If individuals that could learn to react to a variety of
possible signals produced more offspring, then individuals today will
possess a genotype, typical of the species as the result of a history of
natural selection, that enables this type of learning. In a sense the
genotype makes for individuality, because the exact signals that will
induce the behavior will depend on the individual's own special his­
tory of those particular signals preceding a particular phylogenetically
important event.
These events that we have been calling phylogenetically important
tend to be important (in the sense of inducing behavioral reactions) to
all the members of a species. This uniformity suggests an evolutionary
history in which those individuals in the population for which these
events were important (in the present sense) left more offspring. Those
genotypes that made for individuals in whom food and sex failed to
induce appropriate behavior (were unimportant) are no longer with us.
A distinction must be made between what was important long ago,
during phylogeny, and what we consider important in our society
today. The evolutionary history that made food, sex, and other events
phylogenetically important extended over millions of years. The cir­
cumstances in the environment that linked the events with fitness a
million years ago could be absent today because human culture can
change enormously in only a few centuries, an amount of time that

could never produce any significant evolutionary change in our species.
For example, if a new generation begins every 20 years, 300 years
represents only 15 generations, far too few for much change in geno­
types. All the changes that have occurred as a result of the Industrial
Revolution - the growth of cities and factories, cars and airplanes,
nuclear weapons, the nuclear family - can have had no effect on the
behavioral tendencies supported by our genotypes. Thus, our evolu­
tionary history may have prepared us poorly for some of today's
challenges. When the doctor approaches to give you a shot, your
tendency may be to tense up, prepare for the danger, be ready for
flight or aggression, when the appropriate response is to relax. With
nuclear weapons in our hands, how much more important it becomes
to curb aggressive tendencies that evolved at a time when a stick
would have been a powerful weapon!

70

71

Reinforcers and Punishers
Why do we submit meekly to injections? Behavior analysts explain
our tendency to submit rather than resist by the consequences of these
actions. Resistance might avoid some pain in the short run, but allowing
the shot is linked to more important consequences, such as health and
reproduction, in the long run. The tendency of consequences to shape
behavior serves as the basis for a second type of learning, operant
conditioning or learning.
Phylogenetically important events, when they are the consequences
of behavior, are called reinforcers and punishers. Those events that during
phylogeny enhanced fitness by their presence are called reinforcers,
because they tend to increase behavior that produces them. Examples
are food, shelter, and sex. If food and shelter are obtained by working,
then I work. If sex is obtained by performing courtship rituals special
to my culture - dating - then I date. Those events that during phylogeny
enhanced fitness by their absence are called punishers, because they
tend to suppress (punish) behavior that produces them. Examples are
pain, cold, and illness. If I pet a dog and it bites me, I will be less likely
to pet it again. If eating nuts makes me sick, I will be less likely to
eat nuts. Such changes in behavior because of its consequences are
examples of operant learning.

between two stimuli (a phylogenetically important event and a signal)

Figure 4.2:

Four types of relations engendering operant learning

operant learning occurs as a result of a relationship between a stimulus
and an activity (a phylogenetically important event and the behavior
that affects its occurrence). Broadly speaking, behavior and conse­
quences have two types of relation: positive and negative. If you hunt or
work for food, this behavior tends to produce food or makes it more
likely. This is a positive relation between a consequence (food) and an
activity (hunting or working). If Gideon is allergic to nuts, he checks
the ingredients of prepared foods before eating them to make sure
they contain no nuts or nut oils in them and to avoid getting sick. This
relation is a negative one; the activity (checking) prevents the con­
sequence (sickness) or makes it less likely.
With two types of activity-consequence relation (positive and
negative) and two types of consequence (reinforcers and punishers),
the world contains four types of relation that can engender operant
learning (figure 4.2). The dependence between work and food is an
example of positive reinforcement: reinforcement, because the relation
tends to strengthen or maintain the activity (working), and positive
because the activity makes the reinforcer (food) likely. The relation
between tooth-brushing and tooth decay is an example of negative
reinforcement: reinforcement, because the relation tends to maintain
tooth-brushing (the activity), and negative because brushing makes tooth
decay (the punisher) less likely. The relation between walking on icy
patches and falling is an example of positive punishment: punishment,
because the relation makes walking on ice (the activity) less likely, and
positive because the activity makes the punisher (falling) more likely.
The relation between making noise while hunting and catching prey is
an example of negative punishment: punishment, because the relation
tends to suppress making noise, and negative because making noise
(the activity) makes catching prey less likely.

Evolutionary Theory and Reinforcement

73

Phylogenetically important events are not the only reinforcers and
punishers: The signals of phylogenetically important events that enter
into respondent conditioning also function as reinforcers and punishers.
A dog that has been trained to press a lever to produce food will press
the lever also to produce a tone that is followed by food. As long as
the tone continues to signal the food - the relation of respondent
conditioning - the tone serves to reinforce the dog's lever pressing.
This explains why people work for money as well as food itself; as in
respondent conditioning, money is paired with food and other goods .
When a reinforcer or punisher is the result of respondent condition­
ing like this, it is called acquired or conditional. The phylogenetically
important events that bear directly on fitness are called unconditional
reinforcers and punishers. Money and a tone signaling food are condi­
tional reinforcers. Painful events in a doctor's office may make the
office itself a conditional punisher.
In human society, the events that become conditional reinforcers
and punishers are many and varied. They differ from culture to
culture, from person to person, and from time to time within one's
lifetime. When I was in the first grade, I strove for gold stars; when
my children were in the first grade, I encouraged them to strive for
happy-face stickers. In the United States, when we are ill we make
appointments with physicians; in other cultures people make appoint­
ments with magicians and shamans. Gideon, who is allergic to nuts,
finds the smell and sight of peanut butter disgusting and avoids the
stuff; I, who eat it for lunch, buy it at the store all the time. My problem
is with green peppers; when I am served salad in a restaurant, I pick
them out.
Whether such a stimulus becomes or remains a conditional reinforcer
or punisher depends on its signaling an unconditional reinforcer or
punisher. Money remains a reinforcer only as long as it signals the
availability of food and other unconditional reinforcers. In the early
years of the United States, the government issued currency called
"continentals" that became worthless because it was backed by too
little gold - that is, there was too little possibility of redeeming the
paper for reliable money. People refused to accept the paper money as
payment - that is, it ceased to function as a reinforcer. My friend
Mark, who is a skydiver, was terrified the first time he jumped from
an airplane. However, after many jumps with no mishap, he began
jumping without hesitation; jumping ceased to be a punisher. I, who
have never jumped out of an airplane, can only marvel at the power
of the conditional reinforcers that would maintain this behavior.
This last example illustrates an important point to remember when
we are discussing reinforcement and punishment: behavior often

has mixed consequences. Slogans like "No pain, no gain" and "Thank
God it's Friday" point to this fact of life. Life is full of choices between
alternatives that offer different mixes of reinforcers and punishers.
Going to work entails both getting paid (positive reinforcement) and
suffering hassles (positive punishment), whereas calling in sick may
forfeit some pay (negative punishment), avoid the hassles (negative
reinforcement), allow a vacation (positive reinforcement), and incur
some workplace disapproval (positive punishment). Which set of
relations wins out depends on which relations are strong enough to
dominate, and that depends on both the present circumstances and
the person's history of reinforcement and punishment.

with experience. Conversely, some seemingly conditional reinforcers
and punishers are so easily acquired that they hardly seem condi­
tional. To children and some adults, candy is a powerful reinforcer.
Our ancestors, who ate a lot of fruit, benefited from a predilection for
sweet-tasting food, because ripe (sweet) fruit is more nutritious than
unripe fruit. As a result, most humans seem to come into the world
prepared to develop a sweet tooth - unfortunately for some of us,
now that rapid cultural change has made sweets readily available.
Another example of such prepared learning is fear of snakes. Many
children will handle snakes readily and show no fear of them, but
show a special sensitivity to any suggestion that snakes are objects to
be feared. The same child that a week ago handled a snake may today
scream and hide at the sight of the same snake. To our ancestors
snakes probably were a real hazard, and selection would have favored
those individuals disposed to be fearful. Indeed, experiments with
monkeys show that they have the same pattern of initial neutrality
followed by extremely easy acquisition of snake fear (Mineka et aI.,
1984).
Humans seem to be particularly sensitive also to signs of approval
and disapproval in others. Some of these signs, such as the smile and
the frown, are universal; others vary from culture to culture. Approval
and disapproval may be expressed by sounds, gestures, and even bodily
postures too subtle for an outsider to notice, but apparent to all who
grow up in that culture. In a social species like ours, the reproductive
success of each individual depends on good relations with other
members of the community. Our history of selection favored both a
sensitivity to unconditional cues like smiles and frowns and an ability
to learn any conditional cues especially easily.
Instead of trying to divide reinforcers and punishers into two
categories, conditional and unconditional, we might speak of a
continuum of conditionality, from highly conditional to minimally con­
ditional. Sweets and snakes might be minimally conditional, whereas
money and failing an exam would be more conditional. Smiles and
frowns might be minimally conditional, whereas subtle slights and
boosts might be highly conditional. Whichever view we adopt, two
points seem clear: (1) The range of events that can be reinforcers and
punishers is extremely wide, and (2) directly or indirectly all reinforcers
and punishers ultimately derive their power from their effects on fitness
- that is, from a history of evolution by natural selection.
The third physiological influence is to prepare the way for certain
types of operant learning. The structure of my body makes some
learning unlikely. No matter how much I try to spread my wings, I
never learn to fly. An eagle, on the other hand, is exceedingly likely to

Biological factors
Reinforcement and punishment need to be understood in light of
the circumstances in which our species evolved. Since sensitivity to
reinforcement and punishment enhances fitness only under some
circumstances, and some such sensitivities enhance fitness more than
others, phylogeny has provided us with physiology that both helps
and hinders the action of reinforcement and punishment in various
ways. Behavior analysis considers three sorts of physiological influence.
First, no reinforcer functions as a reinforcer all the time. If you have
just eaten three slices of apple pie, and your gracious host offers yet a
fourth, you are likely now to refuse. No matter how powerful the
reinforcer, it is possible to have enough. If you have gone for a while
without the reinforcer, it is likely to be powerful; this is deprivation. If
you have had a lot of the reinforcer lately, it is likely to be weak; that
is satiation. A reinforcer may even become a punisher, as anyone knows
who has ever overeaten. If you have already satiated on apple pie,
having to eat another slice would actually be too much of a good
thing, a punisher. Medieval water torture exploited the punishing
effects of forcing a person to drink water beyond capacity. These tend­
encies for reinforcers to wax and wane and even turn to punishers
evolved because individuals that possessed them survived and repro­
duced better than those that lacked them.
Second, we may come into the world physiologically prepared for
certain kinds of respondent conditioning. Some conditional reinforcers
and punishers seem be more easily acquired than others. Some require
a lot of experience and some very little. Even some seemingly uncon­
ditional reinforcers and punishers appear to depend a bit on experi­
ence. When I was a child, I hated mushrooms, but today I put them
raw in my salad. Likewise, the reinforcing power of sex seems to grow

spread its wings and learn to fly. Of course, it learns partly because it
has wings, but also because it is predisposed to use them. Our species,
too, is predisposed to behave in certain ways and learn certain skills.
Children come into the world especially sensitive to speech sounds
and begin to babble at an early age. Virtually all children, without
special instruction, come to speak the language spoken around them
by the age of two. Speaking is learned because of its consequences, by
the effects it has on other people, who provide reinforcement and
punishment. Children learn to request cookies because that is how
they get others to give them cookies. But this learning is highly pre­
pared. For a human, speaking is so crucial to fitness that genes favoring
the learning of speech would be strongly selected. As a result the
physiology of our bodies makes it virtually certain that we will learn
this skill.
As a result of our physiology, some skills will be easy to learn,
whereas others, no matter how important in life today, will be less
helped. Compare learning to speak with learning to read and write.
The first requires no instruction; the other demands schools and
teachers. Learning calculus can be helpful, but it remains a challenge
to most people, whereas almost anyone can learn to drive a car. The
sort of coordination of eyes, hands, and feet required for driving, also
important in hunting prey and evading predators, comes easily to us,
whereas abstract thinking takes more effort. Hunting and being hunted
went on for millions of years, whereas calculus was invented less than
400 years ago. This means that all skills are not equally easy to acquire,
and that operant learning may work much better with some skills
(speaking and driving) than with others (reading and calculus).

fitness during phylogeny, natural selection provided the physiolo­
gical equipment necessary for this type of flexibility. Those fixed
action patterns that serve as a base for respondent conditioning
(unconditional stimuli and responses, according to Pavlov) serve
also as a base for operant learning, as unconditional reinforcers and
punishers. The signals or conditional stimuli of respondent condi­
tioning function as conditional reinforcers and punishers in operant
learning.
4. It provides physiological mechanisms of deprivation and satiation,
by which reinforcers and punishers wax and wane in their power
to affect behavior.
5. It selects biases that favor conditioning of certain signals in respond­
ent conditioning and reinforcing of certain activities in operant
learning. Since such signals and activities are especially important
to fitness, but some flexibility is also good for fitness, physiological
mechanisms are selected that make such learning especially easy.

History of Reinforcement
The term "history of reinforcement" in behavior analysis is really
short for " history of reinforcement and punishment," an individual's
history of operant learning from birth. In this section we will see that
it is a history of selection by consequences analogous to phylogeny.
Reinforcement and punishment shape behavior as it develops during
an individual's lifetime (during the on togeny of behavior) in the same
way that reproductive success shapes the traits of a species during
phylogeny.

Overview of Phylogenetic Influences
A history of natural selection affects behavior in five ways:
1. It provides reliable patterns of behavior - reflexes and fixed action
patterns - that aid survival and reproduction.
2. It favors genotypes that provide the capacity for respondent condi­
tioning, in which a variety of neutral stimuli become promises and
threats of up-coming situations (releasers) requiring fixed action
patterns. Since that capacity to learn enhanced fitness, the physiolo­
gical equipment necessary for it was selected.
3. It favors genotypes that provide the capacity for operant condition­
ing, in which consequences (reinforcers and punishers) shape the
behavior on which they depend. Since operant learning enhanced

Selection by Consequences
In figure 4.1, individual giraffe ancestors that had shorter necks tended
to produce fewer surviving offspring on the average than those with
longer necks. The lesser and greater fitnesses (reproductive successes)
were consequences of the shorter and longer necks. As long as those
differential consequences remained (curves 1 and 2 in figure 4.1),
average neck length in the population continued to grow. When the
process reached its limit (curve 3), variation in neck length still had
differential consequences, except now either too short or too long a
neck results in lower average reproductive success, because the vari­
ation in neck length spans the point of maximum fitness (the broken

line in figure 4.1). Now the differential consequences of neck length
act to stabilize the population.
The general rule of thumb in phylogeny is that within a popula­
tion of individuals that vary in genotype, those types that are more
successful tend to become or remain the most frequent. An analogous
rule holds for ontogeny by reinforcement and punishment; it is known
as the law of effect.

The law of effect
Successful and unsuccessful behavior are defined by their effects.
In everyday terms, successful behavior produces good effects, and
unsuccessful behavior produces less good or bad effects. In operant
learning, success and failure correspond to reinforcement and punish­
ment. A successful activity is one that is reinforced; an unsuccessful
activity is one that is less reinforced or punished.
The law of effect is the principle that underlies operant learning . .
It states that the more reinforced an activity is, the more it tends to
occur, and the more punished an activity is, the less it tends to occur.
The results of the law of effect are often spoken of as shaping, because
as more successful types of behavior wax and less successful types
wane, it is like a sculptor molding a lump of clay, building up here,
pressing down there, until the lump takes desired shape. When you
were first learning to write, even the crudest approximations to letters
like 0 and c met with high praise. Some of these efforts were better than
others, and the better ones were usually more praised. Really poor
performance might even have produced disapproval. Gradually, your
letters became better shaped. (Standards shifted, too; shapes that were
praised at an early stage produced disapproval at a later stage.)

Shaping and natural selection
Behavior analysts think of the shaping of behavior as working in
just the same way as the evolution of species. Just as differences in
reproductive success (fitness) shape the composition of a population
of genotypes, so reinforcement and punishment shape the composition
of an individual's behavior. To make the parallel clear, we need to
think of the collection of all behavior of a certain sort - say, driving
a car to work - that a person engages in over a period of time - say, a
month - as being like a population of giraffes. Driving to work is a
species of behavior, just as giraffes are a species of animal, and all the
driving I do in a month is a population of driving activity, just as all

Relative
Efficiency

Shaping by reinforcement and punishment

the giraffes in the Serengeti Plain are a population of giraffes. Just
as some giraffes are more successful at producing offspring, so some
of my driving episodes (actions; chapter 3) are more successful in get­
ting me to work. Some include maneuvers that gain time; these are
reinforced. Others lose time or prove dangerous; these are punished.
The successful actions tend to become more frequent or at least are
maintained from month to month, and the unsuccessful actions tend
to become less frequent or at least remain rare from month to month,
just as the more successful types of giraffes tend to remain more
common and the less successful types of giraffes tend to remain rare.
Just as more successful types of giraffes are selected by their success,
so more successful types of driving are selected by their success. Over
time, selection results either in evolution of driving or stabilization of
driving.
Suppose we take figure 4.1 and substitute driving speed relative
to the speed limit for neck length and efficiency (making good time
without excessive danger) for fitness. The result is figure 4.3. The three
frequency curves might refer to different stages in my learning to
drive. At first, I tended to drive at low speed (curve 1). As I gained
competence, I drove faster (curve 2). Since those speeds tended to be
less efficient (less reinforced), gradually my driving shifted to where it
is today (curve 3), coinciding on the average with the most efficient
speed, represented by the broken line (about 5 miles per hour above
the speed limit).
Just as with natural selection, reinforcement and punishment operate
on the population and on the average. When my driving to work was

efficiency only on the average. Sometimes greater speed was less effi­
cient; perhaps I got stopped by a police officer or had an accident.
Sometimes greater speed was no more efficient; maybe I went fast
only to be trapped behind a school bus or at a railroad crossing in
the final stretch. Not every action of a type need be reinforced or
punished for the type to be increased or suppressed; the type only
need be reinforced or punished more on the average over time.
For evolution or stabilization of a population by natural selection,
three ingredients are necessary: variation, reproduction, and differen­
tial success. (1) Selection among possibilities requires more than one
possibility - that is, the individuals in the population must vary in the
trait (neck length in figure 4.1, but it could be speed, coloration, or a
host of other traits). (2) The different variants must tend to reproduce
themselves - that is, offspring should resemble their parents from
generation to generation, resulting in the variants recurring from
generation to generation. For natural selection, this recurrence results
from genetic inheritance. Long- and short-necked giraffes inherit their
long and short necks from their parents. (3) Among the variants, some
must be more successful than others (i.e., there must be competition).
If all variants were equally fit - if instead of the fitness curve shown in
figure 4.1 fitness were represented by a flat line - then the trait (neck
length) would neither shift in a particular direction nor remain stable,
but drift unpredictably from time to time. Since too short a neck lowers
fitness, the population moves steadily toward longer necks; when too
long a neck also lowers fitness, the population remains stable.
Shaping by reinforcement and punishment requires the same three
ingredients: variation, recurrence, and differential success. (1) For
shaping, the variation occurs within the population of actions that
serve a similar purpose (driving, in our example, which serves to get
us to work). You hardly ever engage in the same activity exactly the
same way twice. Sometimes you brush your teeth hard, sometimes
easy. Sometimes you speak in a high pitch, sometimes in a low pitch.
Sometimes I drive above the speed limit, sometimes below it. The
population of harder and softer tooth-brushings, higher- and lower­
pitched utterances, or faster and slower drives varies just the same
way as the population of shorter- and longer-necked giraffes. (2) For
shaping to occur, activities must tend to recur (reproduce) from time
to time. If I go rock-climbing once in my life, and never go again, my
rock-climbing has no chance to be shaped. Since I brush my teeth
every day, my tooth-brushing has plenty of chance to be shaped. (3)
For shaping, differential success means differential reinforcement and
punishment. I speak loudly to my deaf grandmother because otherwise

she cannot hear me and provide reinforcers for my speaking to her.
If I speak too loudly, she reprimands me with " Don't you shout at
me, young man." Most of the time I find a loudness at which she
and I can carry on a nice conversation; so, some loudnesses are more
successful than others, just as in figure 4.3 some speeds are more
successful than others. As in natural selection, population size is limited
- you brush your teeth only two or three times a day and do only so
much driving to work in a month. Since the more successful variants
tend to recur more often from day to day or month to month, the less
successful variants tend to become less frequent. As long as some
variants are reinforced or punished more than others, the action popu­
lation will either shift or remain stable, as in figure 4.3.
When one person dispenses reinforcers and punishers purposefully
to change the behavior of another person, it is called training, teaching,
or therapy. Whether we are talking about an athletic coach training a
team, an animal trainer training a bear to dance, a teacher teaching a
child to read, or a therapist helping a client to be more assertive with
superiors, the same principles of reinforcement and punishment apply.
The only difference is that these instances of shaping constitute
relationships - that is, two people are involved, both of whose behavior
is being shaped. (More about this in chapters 7, 9 and 11.)
Training, teaching, and therapy resemble selective breeding, the
process in which reproductive success (which individuals get to breed)
is determined by a person, rather than by the natural environment.
When farmers breed only the cows that produce the most milk, they
are capitalizing on the inheritance of milk production, just as natural
selection capitalizes on the inheritance of advantageous traits in the
natural environment. Darwin got the idea of natural selection in part
from observing selective breeding. He saw that the same principles
could apply on the farm and in nature. Similarly, the same principles
of reinforcement and punishment apply in our "natural," unstructured
environment and in situations structured especially for behavior
change.

Historical Explanations
The parallel between natural selection and shaping is no accident, as
both ideas exist to solve similar problems. In chapter 1, we saw how
Darwin's theory of natural selection provided the first scientific account
of evolution. Prior to that, even though many thinkers rejected the
exact account in the Bible, evolution was commonly regarded as the
result of God's design, intelligence, or purpose. From a scientific point

of view, such an "explanation" is unacceptable, because it fails to
advance understanding and impedes efforts at making true advances.
Just as natural selection replaced divine design, intelligence, or purpose,
selection by reinforcement and punishment replaces mentalistic
"explanations" of behavior that refer to design, intelligence, or purpose
inside the person or animal behaving.
Figure 4.4 shows a summary of the parallel between natural
selection and shaping. Both ideas rely on the notion of gradual change
through time - a history. In evolution by natural selection, the history
is phylogeny, the gradual shift of genetically based traits. In behavior­
shaping, the history is the gradual shift of an individual's behavior
due to interaction with the reinforcement and punishment relations in
his or her environment (figure 4.2). Your personal history of reinforce­
ment and punishment includes all those times when your behavior
produced food, money, approval, pain, or disapproval - all those con­
sequences that shaped your behavior into what it is today. It is part of
the ontogeny of your behavior.
Both ideas refer to a population within which variation occurs. In
evolution, variation occurs within a population of individuals, the key
variation being in the individuals' genotypes. In shaping, variation
occurs within a population of action-types, all the different ways
that an individual performs a certain task or activity, such as tooth­
brushing or going to the store.
Both ideas require recurrence of types. In natural selection, geno­
types are passed from generation to generation by genetic inheritance.
In shaping, activities repeat because the occasions for them repeat. I
brush my teeth every morning and every night because I get up every
morning and go to sleep every night. People often call such repetition
"habit." The exact mechanism underlying habit must lie in the nervous
system, but much less is known about that than about the genetic
transfer of characteristics from parents to offspring.

83

Both ideas attribute change to selection by differential success.
In natural selection, change in the genotypes composing a population
occurs due to differential fitness or reproductive success. In shaping,
change in the ways an activity is performed (the action-types) is
due to differential reinforcement and punishment, the differences in
effectiveness of the different action-types.
Finally, each idea replaces an earlier unscientific account. Natural
selection replaces God the Creator, the hidden force guiding evolution,
with an explanation in purely natural terms. The apparent intelligence
and purposefulness of life forms are seen as the outcome of selection
acting on variation. Giraffes benefit from long necks, but neither they
nor the Creator need be given credit for this, because the environment
made long necks good and selected them as well. Shaping by rein­
forcement and punishment also replaces hidden forces, the mentalistic
causes of behavior, with explanations in purely natural terms. The
intelligence and purposefulness of actions are seen as the outcome
of selection (reinforcement and punishment) acting on variation. I
benefit from skillful driving, but neither I nor any inner purpose or
intelligence need be given any credit for this, because the environment
made skillful driving good and selected it as well.
Historical explanations like natural selection and reinforcement
differ from scientific explanations that rely on immediate causes. The
sun's rising is explained by an immediate cause, the earth's rotation.
In historical explanation, the " cause" of the event is nowhere present,
but is a whole history of past events. The long neck of the giraffe
cannot be wholly explained by any event at its birth or even at its
conception, but is explained by the long history of selection that pro­
duced it over millions of years. Similarly, my driving speed cannot be
wholly explained by any event while I am driving or even when I get
into the car, but is explained by the long history of shaping that pro­
duced it over many months or years.
Evolutionary biologists distinguish between proximate explanations
and ultimate explanations (Alcock, 1998). The proximate explanation
of a behavioral trait points to the physiological mechanisms that
determine the trait's development from conception. An individual's
genetic endowment explains, in a proximate way, why the individual
sneezes, smiles, and is able to learn. But the larger question of why the
individual has that genetic endowment in the first place cannot be
explained by the moment of conception or any other moment. The
ultimate explanation points to the individual's membership in a popu­
lation or species and, strictly speaking, applies to the population and
not to the individual at all. Human beings sneeze and learn because
that reflex and that capacity enhanced reproductive success among

A Scientific Model of Behavior

Evolutionary Theo ry and Reinfo rcement

humans and their ancestors over many millions of years; that is the
ultimate explanation.
Ultimate explanations are historical explanations; proximate explana­
tions are explanations in terms of immediate causes. If enough were
known about the physiology of the nervous system, someone might
be able to explain why I drove 55 miles per hour at 8 :55 on the morning
of June 10. That would be a proximate explanation of that particular
instance of my behavior, just as molecular genetics and embryology
might provide a proximate explanation of why I have two hands and
feet. But why the population of my driving speeds is what it is month
after month cannot be explained by the physiology of my nervous
system, just as why human beings have two hands and feet cannot be
explained by any one person's genetics or embryological development.
The population requires an ultimate or historical explanation. On a
particular occasion, I may hand over my wallet to a man with a gun;
the historical explanation points to this event's membership in a popula­
tion (activity), called, say, "complying with a threat," and the long
history of reinforcement for complying with threats, from the play­
ground to the classroom to the streets of New York City.
People seem to prefer proximate explanations, probably because
events like billiard balls knocking into one another are simpler to
think about than histories. When an action appears to have no imme­
diate cause, instead of pointing to the history of reinforcement that
produced the activity to which the action belongs, one might be tempted
to provide an immediate cause by making one up. If the history of
reinforcement responsible for Zack's going to a movie when he should
be studying is obscure, one might be tempted to say his will power
collapsed. That, of course, is mentalism.
Chapter 3 criticized mentalism at length, but never offered any
alternative; now we are in a position to suggest a scientifically accept­
able account of purpose and intention. As we noted at the beginning
of this part of the book, particulars of the account will change as
time goes on. We need only establish that a truly scientific
account is

possible. That is the subject of chapter 5.

conditioning, the capacity for operant learning, reinforcers and pun­
ishers that change in power with time and context, and biases that favor
certain types of respondent conditioning and operant learning.
Second, the theory of evolution provides an example of historical
explanation, the type of explanation that applies to operant behavior.
A history of reinforcement and punishment parallels a history of natural
selection, except that the first operates on a type of behavior (popula­
tion of actions) within the lifetime of an individual, whereas the
second operates on a species (population of organisms) over many
generations. Both concepts replace nonscientific accounts that refer to
a hidden intelligent agent directing evolutionary or behavioral change.
Although explanations in physics and chemistry rely on immediate
causes, historical explanations refer to the cumulative effects of many
events over a long period of time. Changes produced in a population
as a result of selection by consequences cannot be pinpointed at a
particular moment. Like phylogeny, a history of reinforcement refers
to many events of the past, all of which together produced present
behavior.

84

Summary
The theory of evolution is important to behavior analysis in two ways.
First, much behavior originates in genetic inheritance derived from
the species' evolutionary history (phylogeny). Natural selection pro­
vides reflexes and fixed action patterns, the capacity for respondent

Say that someone told you that you should read Moby Dick, so you
hunt for a copy in the local bookstores. The first doesn't have any,
so you go to another store. Such behavior is often called purposive
because it is supposedly driven by an inner purpose (obtaining and
reading Moby Dick). Behavior analysts reject the notion that an inner
purpose guides the activity. What scientifically acceptable alternative
do they offer?
Chapter 4 examined the close parallels between evolutionary theory
in biology and reinforcement theory in behavior analysis. We saw that
they both rely on historical explanations to replace unscientific notions
about a hidden agent (Creator, intelligence, or will) behind the scenes.
In this chapter, we will see exactly how the idea of a history of rein­
forcement and punishment substitutes for traditional notions about
purpose.

History and Function
We saw in chapter 4 that historical explanations are ultimate explana­
tions, and that ultimate explanations account for the existence of
populations of organisms or actions and have little to say about the
peculiarities of particular individual organisms or actions. Point to a
zebra and ask an evolutionary biologist about its stripes; you will get
an explanation about why zebras as a species have stripes. If you
really want to know why that particular zebra has a pattern of stripes
that make it different from other zebras, you will have to go to an
embryologist or developmentalist. Point to a child and ask a behavior
analyst why he is hitting a companion with a toy truck; you will get

A Scientific Model of Behavior

Purpose and Reinforcement

an explanation about why that child's behavior includes a species of
actions that we call aggressive. If you want to know why the aggres­
sion involves that particular toy and those particular arm muscles,
you will have to go to a physiologist. When evolutionary biologists or
behavior analysts get more specific about a population, they do so by
defining subpopulations or subcategories. White-crowned sparrows
may sing a bit differently from one region to another, and I may drive
faster when I am late than under other circumstances, but sparrows in
a particular region and drives when I am late are still populations and
still explained historically.
Historical explanation and population thinking, which go hand
in hand, both take some getting used to. This is true for historical
explanation in behavior analysis because people are so prejudiced
toward seeking explanations in causes present at the moment of
action. Population thinking takes some getting used to because people
are unaccustomed to grouping actions along the lines of function that is, along the lines of what they accomplish, rather than how they
look. We turn now to a closer look at how historical explanations and
functional definitions work.

anxiety, complexes, or self-esteem adds nothing to what is already
known: the connection between events long ago and behavior today.
Attributing delinquency to low self-esteem in no way explains the
delinquency. Where did the low self-esteem come from? How can it
cause delinquency? Is there any evidence of low self-esteem other than
the behavior it is supposed to explain? Is low self-esteem anything
other than the label for the activity that it is supposed to explain?
The way to escape this trap is to accept that events long ago affect
present behavior directly. If a boy was beaten and neglected as a child,
those events contribute to his stealing cars as a teenager, even across
the gap of time.

88

Using Historical Explanations
At least since Freud's invention of psychoanalysis, psychologists and
laypeople alike have grown accustomed to the idea that events in our
childhood affect our behavior as adults. If I was abused as a child, I
may tend to abuse my own children when I am an adult. If my family
always sat down to supper together, this may seem essential to me
when I am a parent. Such observations form the basis for historical
explanations. I behave so as an adult because of the events of my
childhood.

History versus immediate cause
People seem to be enormously tempted to represent the events of child­
hood somehow in the present. If no obvious cause can be found in the
present, the temptation is to make one up. If I was traumatized as a
child, then it is said that I have " anxiety" or a "complex" that causes
maladaptive behavior today. If a teenager grew up in a dysfunctional
family, then he misbehaves today because he has a "low self-esteem."
Such notions are examples of mentalism, the practice of putting
forward imaginary causes as if they explained behavior. Talking about

89

Gaps of time
That an observed relation between environment and behavior spans
a gap of time has no bearing on its scientific or practical importance.
If people who were abused as children tend to be abusive as adults,
the gap between childhood and adulthood in no way changes the
usefulness of this fact, which may lead to therapy and a fuller under­
standing of the effects of early experience. Even though we have no
idea of what bodily mechanisms allow such relations over time, we
need neither to resort to mentalism nor to hesitate to make use of the
observations.
The situation with gaps of time in behavior analysis resembles that
in physics with action at a distance. The concept of gravity was slow
to be accepted because it seemed strange that a body could exert an
influence on another body even though it was far away. Gravity was
finally accepted because it proved useful in understanding phenomena
as diverse as falling bodies and the effect of the moon on the tides.
Ideas about its mechanism came much later.
We unquestioningly tolerate relations across small gaps of time. If I
stub my toe and am still in pain a minute later, no one would quarrel
with the idea that my behavior now is the result of the stubbing a
minute ago. If a teacher tells a child, " Raise your hand if you are
having trouble," and the child raises her hand after five minutes,
we have no difficulty attributing this action to the combination of
the teacher's instruction and the child's having trouble, even if five
minutes elapsed between them.
Longer gaps, however - years or even hours - seem to give rise to a
temptation to mentalism. In their effects on present behavior, my stub­
bing my toe a minute ago and my having been traumatized 30 years
ago are the same in principle. One occurred a lot longer ago than the

A Scientific Model of Behavior

Purpose and Reinforcement

other, but we need to invent a complex to explain the one no more
than the other. Likewise, combining the teacher's instruction with the
pupil's having trouble and combining a promise made on Monday
with a meeting on Friday are the same in principle. For each, the
combination of the earlier event with the later event makes certain
behavior likely at the later time. The gap of four days no more requires
invention of memory to bridge it than the gap of five minutes.
Responses to instructions and promises that involve gaps of five
minutes or four days imply other, longer, gaps. Just as present
responses to childhood trauma arise across a gap of many years, so
do present responses to instructions and promises arise from events
across a gap of many years. Without a history of taking instructions
and making promises, neither the child nor the teacher could behave
appropriately. For the child to obey the teacher, many times in the
past the child must have been told to do something, to have done it,
and the behavior to have been reinforced. For you to go hunting for
Moby Dick because a friend told you to read it requires occasions in
the past when you followed such advice and the results reinforced
your advice-following. Likewise, the making and keeping of promises
must have been reinforced many times in the past for someone now
to make and keep a promise.
The particular instruction followed may never have been heard
before, and the particular promise made may never have been spoken
before, but each history comprises many instances similar to the present
one. No one ever told you to read Moby Dick before, but people
told you to do other things, some of which you did. The history need
include neither the particular instruction nor the particular promise
because "instruction-taking" and "promise-keeping" are categories
based not on structure or appearance, but on function.

that I will bring home remains unknown, but no doubt remains about
the unit to which I am referring. Similarly, if I say I am going to Africa
to look at giraffes, the particular individuals I will look at remain
unknown, but no doubt remains about the unit " giraffes." If I say
I will give you directions how to get to my house, the particular
instructions remain unknown, but you have no doubt about the unit
"instructions."

90

Functional Units
A functional unit is a population defined by what the members do how they act or function - rather than how they are composed or how
they appear. A structural grouping might be "four-legged furniture,"
because a thing need only be put together in a certain way to belong,
whereas "table" might be a functional grouping, because a thing need
only exist for the purpose of having objects put on it to belong. A table
may have three, four, six, or eight legs; how it is constructed makes no
difference.
A population or species is called a "unit" when it is treated as a
single whole. If I say I am going to buy a table, the particular object

91

Species as functional units
Before the advent of modern evolutionary theory, creatures were com­
monly classified according to how they looked, or according to their
structure. This worked fairly well, except that disputes arose when
two species looked so much alike that it was practically impossible
to tell them apart. Variation in coloration and skeletal structure within
a species of lizard might make it impossible to say just by looking
whether a particular specimen was a member of that species or another
similarly varying species.
Nowadays, evolutionary biologists no longer define species accord­
ing to their structure; instead, they define them according to how they
reproduce. A species is a population, the members of which breed
with one another, but not with members of other such populations.
Each species is a reproducing unit, distinct from other such reprodu­
cing units because mating occurs within a species but not between
species. Two species of frog exist that are indistinguishable by appear­
ance and anatomy, and yet one breeds at sunrise and the other at
sunset. They are two distinct species, because members of the two
never interbreed. Even if two frogs from different species can be made
to interbreed in the laboratory, if they never interbreed in the natural
habitat, they still belong to two distinct species. Hyenas look different
from jackals, but what makes them different species is that hyenas
and jackals do not breed with one another. What matters is what the
species do - how they function reproductively - not how they look or
sound or are constructed.

Activities as fu nctional units
The molar action categories discussed by Ryle and temporally
extended activities discussed by Rachlin (chapter 3) are functional units.
Their members include activities that extend through time (e.g., Aaron's
loving Marcia includes his writing about her in his diary) and that
may be interrupted by other activities (e.g., working).

A Scientific Model of Behavio r

Purpose and Reinforcement

An operant activity is a population of actions all of which have
the same environmental effect. In the laboratory, commonly studied
activities are lever-pressing and key-pecking. Lever-pressing, for
example, includes within it all the actions that have the effect of
depressing the lever. Whether the rat presses the lever with its left
paw, right paw, nose, or mouth makes no difference; all of these are
counted as lever-pressing. In the world at large, we recognize operant
activities when we speak of "opening the front door" or "walking
downtown" as units. As with lever-pressing, opening the front door
comprises all actions that have the effect of getting the door open.
Whether I open it with my left hand or right hand makes no differ­
ence; both count as opening the front door. In the molar view, opening
the front door would constitute an activity; it might be interrupted
by straightening one's clothes, but the whole would be an episode of
the activity, and possibly part of the more extended activity of greet­
ing a guest.
Speaking of behavior in terms of functional units is not really a
choice, but a necessity. One has only to watch a rat to see that it
actually does press the lever in a variety of ways. This variability
might be reduced by specifying, say, that only right-paw pressing can
be reinforced, but then the rat would press the lever with its right
paw in a variety of ways. Careful observation would always reveal
some variation, because the rat cannot press the lever exactly the same
way twice. Each individual action is unique.
If this uniqueness of actions seems like a fatal blow to a science
of behavior, it is well to remember that every science faces the same
problem. To the astronomer, each individual star is unique; that is
why they are given proper names. To understand stars, the astronomer
groups them into categories: white giants, red dwarfs, and so on.
Although every creature is unique, the biologist understands living
things by grouping them into species. In a sense, it is the very business
of science to group things and events into categories or species.
Recognizing sameness is the beginning of explanation.
The units of behavior must be groupings, but why functional group­
ings? Why not group actions, for example, according to which limbs
or muscles are involved? The answer is that structurally defined group­
ings work for behavior no better than they work for species. As with a
species, you can tell an action belongs to the activity " lever-pressing"
pretty well by looking, but any ambiguity will be resolved not by how
the action looks but by what it does - whether the lever actually gets
depressed. However much I may go through the motions of opening
the front door, the action does not count as opening the front door
unless the door opens.

An illustration of the impossibility of defining an activity by its
structure is the following excerpt from an announcement, written
by Douglas Hintzman at the University of Oregon, of an upcoming
lecture to be given by a scholar whom we will call "Dr. X" :

92

93

I asked Dr. X to explain "reading." He replied that it is a method that
millions have used to gain enlightenment. Practitioners of this art
("readers," as Dr. X calls them) adopt a sitting position and remain
virtually motionless for long periods of time. They hold before their
faces white sheets of paper covered with thousands of tiny figures and
waggle their eyes rapidly back and forth. While thus engaged, they are
difficult to arouse and appear to be in a trance. I didn't see how this
bizarre activity could bring knowledge . . . "Suppose I stare at this piece
of paper and jerk my eyes back and forth," I said, grabbing a page from
his desk. " Will that make me wise?" "No," he replied, growing annoyed
at my skepticism. " It takes many years of practice to become a proficient
reader. Besides, that was written by a Dean."

As with pressing a lever or opening a door, "reading" is defined
not by how it looks, but by what it does. Reading aloud occurs when
the audience can hear it. Silent reading occurs when the reader can
demonstrate comprehension afterwards by answering questions or
otherwise acting in accord with the text.
Typically, we assign a particular action to a functional unit on the
basis of both its effect and its context. A rat presses a lever in the
context of the experimental chamber in which lever-pressing has many
times in the past produced food. Lever-pressing in another context say a chamber in which it produced water - would belong to a differ­
ent activity. The two activities could be labeled " lever-pressing for
food" and " lever-pressing for water," as long as we remind ourselves
that "for such-and-such" here means "which has produced such­
and-such in the past." We may consider "complying with a threat" an
activity because its members occur in a certain context (a "threat") and
have historically had a certain effect (removal of the threat). Handing
my wallet to my wife for her to remove money is a different activity
from handing my wallet to a mugger.
" Hunting for an item in stores" defines a functional unit that occurs
in a certain context - the item's allowing further activities that will
ultimately be reinforced. Someone telling you to read Moby Dick sets
the context for you to hunt for the book, because having it allows
reading it, which is likely to be reinforced. " Hunting for Moby Dick in
stores" and reading Moby Dick may be parts of the activity " enjoying
Moby Dick."

A Scientific Model of Behavior

Purpose and Reinforcement

In behavior analysis we speak of history as defining the context
and consequences of an act, whereas, in everyday talk, we would say
that different acts have different purposes. We turn now to the ways
in which behavior analysis addresses the various uses of the word
purpose.

All these ways of speaking might apply to your hunting in book­
stores for Moby Dick. The goal is obtaining the book, but obtaining the
item is the usual effect of hunting and the usual reinforcer for that
activity. You are "trying to find the book" and you "want the book"
mean that you are engaging in behavior that often produced required
items in the past and is likely to produce the book now.
People usually consider goals and desires to involve something more
than simply naming customary reinforcers. They often say that the
person or rat has something "in mind" on these occasions. This brings
us to the next major use of intentional terms.

94

Three Meanings of Purpose
Everyday English has a rich vocabulary for talking about behavior in
relation to its consequences. Not only do we use the word purpose, but
a host of other terms related to it, like intention, expectation, want, wish,
try, and so on. These are what philosophers call " intentional" terms or
"intentional idioms." Despite all their variety, intentional terms can be
grouped, for the most part, into three types of use: function, cause,
and feeling.

Purpose As Function
One use of purpose and its cousins meshes readily with scientific talk.
If I say that the purpose of this paperweight is to hold down these
papers, I have pointed out nothing about the paperweight other than
what it does, other than its function. No controversy arises because
this use of purpose is really like a definition. That is what a paper­
weight is - something that holds down papers.
Applied to behavior, this use of purpose points to effects. The
purpose of lever-pressing is to depress the lever. One could say in this
sense that activities are defined in terms of their purposes. "Walking
home" is an activity that gets me home.
In this context, home is also spoken of as the goal of my walking.
When we are aware of a long history of activity that typically leads to
a certain outcome (home), we use goal to mean the usual reinforcer for
that activity. Speaking this way, one could say that the goal of lever­
pressing is food.
One could even interpret a statement like "I am trying to get home"
this way, if by " trying to get home" I meant " engaging in behavior
that usually gets me home." Seen this way, "The rat is trying to get
food" might simply mean that the rat is pressing a lever that has
produced food in the past, and "The rat wants food" might only mean
that it is behaving in ways that might have been associated with food
in the past.

95

Purpose As Cause
Terms like try and want seem to refer to some event in the future that
will be produced by behavior. " I am trying to open the door" suggests
that my efforts are directed toward a future event, the open door.
Of course, a future event, not having happened yet, cannot cause
my behavior. That would violate a basic rule of science: only events
that actually have happened can produce results. The variables on
which my behavior depends must be in either the past or the present.
The common way of addressing this problem is to move the cause
from the future to the present. Since the open door of the future
cannot cause me to work the latch, it is said that the behavior is caused
by a mental representation of the goal or purpose (the open door).
Since you have yet to find Moby Dick, it is said that your hunting for
the book is caused by a mental representation of it.
However, mental representations of future events are examples of
mentalism and fall prey to all the problems of mentalism that we dis­
cussed in chapter 3. Where is this inner purpose? What is it made of?
How could this ghostly open door cause me to work the latch? How
could an inner representation of Moby Dick cause you to hunt for it?
This is no explanation; it only serves to obscure the relevant facts about
the environment: working the latch usually leads to an open door and
hunting for an item usually produces the item. These natural facts
explain the behavior without any need to bring in an inner purpose.

Purposive behavior
What is it about behavior like working a latch that leads people to
call it purposive? William James wrote that purposive behavior con­
sists of "varying means [varying behavior] to a fixed end [customary

97

reinforcer] ." If you've ever had trouble opening a door, you know
what James meant. Say the key doesn't turn all the way in the lock.
What do you do? You turn the key several more times, turn it quickly,
turn it slowly, push it in, pull it out, jiggle it in and out, and so on.
These are varying means. Eventually the door opens (the fixed end),
and the behavior ceases. In our Moby Dick example, if the book is not
at one store, you go to another store, and another, until, having found
the book, you stop hunting.
Perhaps even more than the variation in action, the activity's ceas­
ing on the occurrence of the reinforcer seems to compel the word
purposive. In James's definition, this aspect is contained in the preposi­
tion to before fixed end. We are inclined to say that the behavior was
directed toward the goal (future reinforcer) because it stops when the
goal is attained (reinforcement occurs). This seems particularly true
of behavior like hunting for something. Say I am at a point in cooking
a dish where the recipe calls for salt. I go to the place where the salt is
usually found, but it is gone. I look on other shelves, on the table, all
around the kitchen, in the dining room, and I ask anyone I see where
the salt is. Eventually I get the salt, stop looking for it, and go on with
cooking. The salt is not only the reinforcer for the activity that we call
" looking for the salt"; it is also the occasion for proceeding to other
activities: that is why the activity ceases.
What might seem troublesome about this account of "looking for
the salt" is that I may never have hunted for the salt before. We often
search for things that we have never searched for before, and someone
might suppose that there could be no history of reinforcement to
explain the behavior.
We have already seen the solution to this sort of problem; it is the
same as the problem with handing over one's wallet to a robber for
the first time. This particular action may never have occurred before,
but others like it have. I may never have complied with this exact
threat before, but I have a long history of complying with threats. I
may never have searched for Moby Dick before, but I have searched
for other books and other things. The details may vary - I search in
bookstores for the book and around the house for the salt - but " search­
ing for household items" and " searching for items in stores" might
be considered functional units of behavior or activities, just like
compliance with threats. Children are often taught explicitly how to
hunt for things around the house. They get better at it only after many
experiences of searching and finding. In some cultures, learning how
to hunt for animals, roots, or berries may be an essential part of grow­
ing up. Hunting for berries is learned in part because of instances of
finding berries in the past.

One can think of examples of apparently purposive behavior in
which the stated goal is never attained. Suppose my cause is to "rid
the world of poverty" or " save the whales." I may have no experience
with poverty or whales, so what history of reinforcement could main­
tain the behavior involved? The answer requires us to consider our
social environment, particularly the types of reinforcement available
to people as a result of participating in a culture. People are taught by
other people to pursue socially useful activities. The reinforcers the
teachers use are usually right at hand, in the form of smiles, affection,
and approval. We will take this up in chapters 8 and 13.

96

Purposive machines
The uselessness of making up inner purposes to explain purposive
behavior becomes especially clear when we look at purposive machines
- that is, known mechanisms that can be said to behave purposively.
A house's heating system is an example. If the air temperature falls
below the setting on the thermostat (say, 68 degrees), the furnace comes
on and heats the air. When the air temperature rises to 68 degrees, the
furnace goes off. We might say that the system tries to keep the tem­
perature at 68 degrees. When it attains this goal or purpose, it ceases
its efforts.
More complicated purposive machines seem to lend their actions
even more readily to intentional talk. The chess-playing computer might
be said to choose moves that it expects will help it toward its inner
purpose of winning. It seems to intend to win and know whether it
has succeeded or failed.
Since the heating system and the computer are machines whose
workings are understood, talking about them in intentional terms may
be fun or poetical, but it is unnecessary. The thermostat contains a
switch that is operated by the temperature to turn the furnace off and
on; that is all there is to its purposiveness. The computer is programmed
to make calculations on each move based on the positions of all the
pieces, and each move depends only on the outcome of those calcula­
tions. The game ends when the result of the calculation coincides
with checkmate. The computer has no inner purpose - only changing
actions in response to changing piece positions (Le., environment).
If the purposiveness of the heating system and the computer can
be illusory, it must be equally true that the purposiveness of a person
can be illusory. The difference is that the mechanism underlying the
person's behavior is unknown. If we knew exactly how the nervous
system allows the environment to be sensed and turned into behavior,

98

A Scientific Model of Behavior

we could point to our insides the same way we can point to the
insides of the thermostat and the computer.
Even without a thorough knowledge of how the thermostat or the
computer works, we can still avoid talking about them in intentional
terms. The thermostat may be just a box on the wall to me, but its
apparent purposiveness still consists only in its being so constructed
that one environmental variable (temperature below 68 degrees) initi­
ates activity, and another (temperature above 68 degrees) turns it off.
The chess-playing computer is built to respond to a set of environ­
mental variables - the positions of all the pieces. Some computers are
programmed to " learn," too; the program records the results of past
moves in similar circumstances. These programs include the past
outcomes when calculating the next move. Whatever the complexity
of the program, each action (move) is still a response to the present
environment and the history of reinforcement (winning).
Similarly, no special knowledge of the inner workings of the human
body is required for me to avoid intentional idioms when discussing
its activities. A satisfactory scientific account can be constructed from
knowledge of present circumstances and consequences of behavior in
similar circumstances in the past.

Selection by conseq uences
Inner purpose is no more necessary or helpful to understand the
behavior of a person than to understand the behavior of the chess­
playing computer. Whether I am hunting for a book or struggling
up a mountain, I have hunted before, and I have struggled before;
the past consequences of those activities in those situations determine
that those activities will be likely to occur again in those situations
(or situation categories).
Selection by consequences invariably implies history. Over time,
successful outcomes (reinforcement) make some activities more likely,
and unsuccessful outcomes (nonreinforcement or pUnishment) make
other activities less likely. Gradually, the behavior that occurs in such
circumstances is shaped - transformed and elaborated. Although
neurophysiologists know little about the mechanism by which the
accumulation of successes and failures changes the behavior, behavior
analysts study the dependence of behavior on that accumulation any­
way. What history of reinforcement determines that a person will
look for something that is lacking? What difference in history deter­
mines that one person will climb a mountain while another will
photograph it?

99

Creativity
What history of reinforcement leads someone to write poetry? Critics
of behaviorism often point to such creative activity as an insurmount­
able challenge. When an artist paints a picture or a poet writes a
poem, the whole point of the activity is to do something never done
before, something original. Seemingly, past consequences could never
account for works of art, because each work is unique and novel. The
originality of each work seems to suggest that somehow the artist is
free of the past, that some inner purpose guides the work.
By emphasizing the uniqueness and novelty of each work, such a
view obscures an equally obvious fact about creative activity: the
relatedness of an artist's works to one another. How do I tell that this
painting is by Monet and that one by Renoir? No two paintings by
the same artist are exactly alike, but paintings by Renoir resemble one
another more than they resemble paintings by Monet. An expert, who
is especially familiar with an artist's works, can usually tell a painting
by that artist even from a careful forgery.
No painter, poet, or composer ever created a work of art in a vacuum.
Each new poem may be unique, but it also shares much in common
with the poet's previous efforts and stems from a long line of poetry
writing by the poet. Along the way, poetry writing was maintained by
at least occasional reinforcers - praise, approval, money - from family,
friends, and other audiences. In other words, poetry writing, like any
operant behavior, is shaped by its history of reinforcement.
Seen in the context of all the artist's works, the uniqueness of the
individual works appears as variation within an activity. Mozart com­
posed many symphonies - composing symphonies was a prominent
activity in his life - but to say that each symphony represented a
unique creative act would be like saying that each time a rat presses
a lever in a new way the rat has engaged in a unique creative act.
Within the activity of symphony composing, each symphony may be
unique, just as within the activity of lever-pressing each press is unique.
This sort of variation occurs in the behavior of inanimate systems,
too. Each snowflake is unique, just as each lever-press is unique. If one
were to insist that some special force (genius or free will) lies behind
each new press or each new work of art, one would have to allow that
such a force lies behind each new snowflake. To suggest that clouds
possess genius or free will seems absurd. Logically speaking, to insist
that human creativity can only be explained by genius or free will is
equally absurd. At the least, we can conclude that if such a force is
unnecessary to explain snowflakes it is unnecessary to explain art.

Purpose and Reinforc ement

A Scientific Model of B eh avio r

A composer differs from a cloud or a rat in that people say the
composer creates something new on purpose. Creative activity aims for
novelty. This means that each new work is composed with an eye
toward those before it. The earlier works set a context in which the
new work may resemble them, but not so much as to be the "same
old thing." Monet did a series of paintings of the same hayricks at
different times of day: the color scheme of each painting sets it apart
from the others. Seen in relation to earlier works, being creative " on
purpose" requires no postulated inner purpose; it requires only that
variation within the activity depend partly on work that has gone
before (i.e., that has been part of the history). Viewed in this light,
porpoises and rats have been trained to be creative "on purpose."
Karen Pryor and her associates at Sea Life Park in Hawaii arranged
that reinforcers were available only for a new response (trick) - some­
thing the porpoise had never done before. Within a few days, new
tricks begin to appear with regularity. The researchers reported that
one porpoise, Malia,
began emitting an unprecedented range of behaviors, including aerial
flips, gliding with the tail out of the water, and "skidding " on the tank
floor, some of which were as complex as responses normally produced
by shaping techniques, and many of which were quite unlike anything
seen in Malia or any other porpoise by Sea Life Park staff. It appeared
that the trainer's criterion, "only those actions will be reinforced which
have not been reinforced previously", was met by Malia with the pres­
entation of complete patterns of gross body movement in which novelty
was an intrinsic factor. (Pryor et al., 1969, p. 653)

My colleague Tony Nevin and some undergraduates at the University
of New Hampshire used a similar criterion to train rats on a tabletop
on which several objects - a box, a ramp, a little swing, a toy truck
were placed. The experimenters reinforced actions with respect to the
objects that they had never seen before. Soon the rats began to display
novel responses to the objects. Should we conclude from these observa­
tions that porpoises and rats possess creative genius?
Novelty may be reinforceable because past behavior can set a con­
text for present behavior. We remember what we have done previ­
ously, and that may incline us to behave either similarly or differently,
depending on what is reinforced. Having failed to find Moby Dick at
one bookstore, you go to a new one. One need postulate an inner
purpose to explain the novelty no more for you or Monet than for the
porpoise or the rat.

Purpose As Peeling: Self-Reports
The third way in which people talk about purpose is as part of private
experience. When we speak of the purposes of others, we can say
nothing of private events, but when we speak of our own purposes,
we may believe we are referring to something present and private.
Every day we ask one another questions about purposes and reply to
one another as if the questions were perfectly reasonable. "Did you
intend to make Zack feel badly?" " No, I was only trying to help."
Such self-reports seem to say that my intentions are part of my experi­
ence of my behavior ("trying to help"). How can I be so sure? We
commonly use the verb feel in this context, as when I say, "I feel like
having some ice cream," or "I feel like taking a walk." What do I
"feel?" What am I talking about?

Talking about the future
Self-reports of purpose present a challenge to scientific explanation
because they seem to talk about the future. What do I mean when I
say I want to go to the beach tomorrow? Since being at the beach lies
in the future and may never happen, one looks instead for something
in the present to account for my saying this now. If I know what I
want, does that mean some inner feeling is talking to me?
Sometimes private cues to self-reports of intention are obvious. If
my stomach is growling or my mouth is parched, I may report that I
feel like eating or drinking. Other times the cues are less clear. I might
find it difficult to say just why I feel like going to a movie. The cues
may be no less real, but I have less experience with them than with a
growling stomach and a parched mouth.
Some of the cues to intentional self-reports may be public. If I cut
myself badly, I may say, "I want to go to the hospital." Other people
can see the cut and understand the statement without bothering
about any private events. I may say, " It's Friday night, and I feel like
a movie." To other people around, the connection is obvious.
The set of all the cues, public and private, that go together to define
the context make it likely that I will make intentional self-reports like,
"I want," "I wish," "I feel like," and so on. What do these mean?
An intentional statement makes a prediction. "I want some ice cream"
means I would eat some ice cream if it were set in front of me, and I
would go to some trouble (drive to the store, clean up my room) to
have ice cream. In other words, I am saying that right now ice cream

A Scientific Model of Behavior

Purpose and Reinforcement

would act as a reinforcer for my behavior. "I feel like taking a walk"
might mean that taking a walk would act as a reinforcer for behavior
allowing me to do so, or it might mean that under these circumstances
taking a walk is behavior that is likely to be reinforced. On the basis of
present cues, intentional statements make predictions about what events
will be reinforcing and what behavior will be reinforced. " I want to
read Moby Dick" means I am likely to read it. " I intend to take the bus"
means I am likely to take the bus.

understanding the history and changing the environment that would
lead to the pregnancy. Blaming the teenager or her parent may be
convenient, but it interferes with effective remedy.

102

Talking about the past
Predicting behavior is like predicting the weather. The weather fore­
caster cannot be absolutely sure it will rain today any more than I can
be absolutely sure I will go to a movie, but we both say, "In circum­
stances like these, such an event is likely." We do this on the basis
of our experience with such circumstances. In the past, when a cold
front met a warm front this way, it often rained. In the past, when I
had nothing else to do on Friday night, I often went to the movies.
Cues in the present determine statements in the present because of
their relations to events of the past.
Apart from including a role for private events, self-reports of inten­
tion differ in no way from intentional statements about others. All
intentional statements, including self-reports, although they appear to
refer to the future, actually refer to the past. Words like intend, want,
try, expect, and propose can always be paraphrased by " In circumstances
like these in the past . . . " When the layperson says that a rat presses a
lever because it wants food, the statement can be rephrased, "In these
circumstances in the past, pressing the lever produced food and food
was a reinforcer." " I propose we go to the beach" means, " In circum­
stances like these in the past, my going to the beach was reinforced,
and it is likely that your going will be reinforced as well."
In everyday speech, intentional idioms are convenient, but in beha­
vior analysis they constitute mentalism. In everyday speech, intentional
statements ease many a social interaction, but for behavior analysis they
are worse than useless, because they direct inquiry toward a shadow
world, instead of toward the natural world. A scientific explanation of
both apparently purposive action and self-reports about felt purpose
relies on present circumstances coupled with past reinforcement in
similar circumstances, both of which are natural and discoverable.
We will never understand or prevent an unmarried teenager's getting
pregnant and going on welfare as long as we say that she felt like it or
was trying to satisfy a need. Such " explanations" only divert us from

103

Feelings as by-products
When feelings act as cues for intentional statements, they constitute
private events of the sensing sort that we discussed in chapter 3. This
type of private event, which includes hearing a sound and feeling a
pain, includes also feeling your flesh crawl and feeling your heart racing.
Feelings as private events, however, tend to be elusive. If I say I feel
afraid, I will probably be able to tell you little about private events
that might make me say that. A physiologist might be able to measure
bodily changes that accompany a report of feeling afraid, but the
person usually has little idea of them.
We usually find it much easier to point to the public circumstances
that account for the feeling. Why do I say I feel afraid? Because I am
hanging from a cliff or about to go for a job interview. Why do I feel
happy? Because I just won the lottery or I got the job I applied for.
Seen in the light of public circumstances, the feelings and the state­
ments about them arise from history with similar circumstances.
Directly or indirectly, they depend on experience with the phylogene­
tically important events that we discussed in chapter 4. Sometimes
feelings arise simply because of genetic programming. We need no
special training to find standing on the top of a cliff frightening or to
find sexual stimulation enjoyable. Most of the time, however, feelings
arise in a situation because that situation has been correlated with
some phylogenetically important event - a reinforcer, punisher, or
unconditional stimulus. In other words, feelings and statements about
feelings arise because of respondent conditioning that occurs along
with operant learning.
English includes a rich vocabulary for talking about the feelings that
accompany situations in which reinforcement and punishment have
occurred in the past. In a situation in which positive reinforcement
is likely, we report feeling happy, proud, confident, eager, ecstatic. If
we are referring to a history of negative reinforcement, we are likely
to report relief. Cancellation of a reinforcer - negative punishment results in reports of disappointment or frustration. Situations in which
positive punishment has occurred in the past give rise to reports of
fear, anxiety, dread, shame, and guilt.
Since feelings arise from the same history of reinforcement and
punishment that accounts for apparently purposive behavior, feelings

104

A Scientific Model of Behavior

are by-products, rather than causes, of the behavior. When you finally
find Moby Dick in a bookstore, you are happy, because now you have
the book, you can read it and obtain further reinforcers, such as being
able to talk about it to other people and the enjoyment of good writ­
ing. Finding the book makes you happy because buying recommended
books and taking recommended actions was reinforced in the past.
You buy the book and you are happy; you do not buy the book
because it makes you happy. The athlete who is happy after scoring a
goal is happy because that situation has often accompanied approval
and other reinforcers. It would be a mistake to say that the athlete tries
to make goals because goals lead to happiness. The behavior that
has often resulted in goals occurs because making a goal is a condi­
tional reinforcer; the feeling of happiness is a by-product of the same
reinforcers (approval and status) that support the conditional reinforcer.
The man who feels guilty after having yelled at his wife brings her
flowers, not because this will relieve his guilt, but because, in . the
past, bringing her flowers (and other acts of kindness) have prevented
punishment and restored reinforcement - that result, of course, also
dissipates the feeling of guilt.
The one exception to the general rule that feelings are only by­
products may be the reports of the feelings. The report " 1 feel happy"
may be viewed as operant (verbal) behavior partly under the control
of private events. Since a full discussion requires that we first address
stimulus control in chapter 6 and then take up verbal behavior in
general, we will discuss this more fully in chapter 7.

Summary
Population-thinking and historical explanation go hand in hand,
because the composition of a population is explained ultimately by its
history of selection - whether that be natural selection operating on a
population of organisms or reinforcement and punishment operating
on a population of actions. Although people commonly recognize that
events in childhood affect one's behavior as an adult, everyday talk
tends to represent the past with fictions in the present. This is mentalism
and in no way helps with the scientific understanding of the behavior.
The temptation to this sort of mentalism arises from a prejudice
toward explaining behavior by causes present at the moment the
behavior occurs. The way to avoid the mentalism is to overcome the
prejudice and allow that events in the past affect behavior in the present,
even if past and present are separated by a gap of time. The gap in no

Purpose and Reinforcement

105

way diminishes the usefulness of understanding present behavior in
the light of history.
Particular actions in the present belong to populations - functional
units or activities - that have a common history because of their com­
mon function. Actions belong to the same functional unit or activity
if they share similar context and consequences. Even though each par­
ticular action has never occurred before, each belongs to some func­
tional unit that has a history of occurring in a certain type of context
with certain types of consequences.
Most uses of purpose and related intentional idioms belong to one
of three types, referring to function, cause, or feeling. When the pur­
pose of an action is equated with its function, with its effect in the
environment, no problem arises for a scientific account. When pur­
pose is thought of as an inner cause, a ghostly representation of con­
sequences is imagined to be present at the moment of action. A future
event cannot explain behavior, but inventing an inner cause fails, too,
because it constitutes mentalism and falls prey to all the problems of
mentalism. A proper scientific explanation of purposive behavior, such
as looking for a book, refers to the history of reinforcement of such
behavior. Creative behavior, too, such as writing poetry, is shaped by
a history of reinforcement for such behavior.
Self-reports of feelings of purpose or intention are cued by present
environment and private events. They consist of predictions about
what events are likely to be reinforcing and what behavior is likely to
be reinforced. Such predictions are always based on reinforcement in
the past. Although self-reports about felt purpose may seem to refer to
the future, they actually refer to one's past, just as statements about
another person's intentions actually refer to that person's past. When
feelings act as cues to self-reports, the feelings are private sensing
events. They are by-products, due to respondent conditioning, of the
same history of reinforcement and punishment as the operant behavior
that the statements are about. They have no causal relationship to
that operant behavior, although they may be part of the context that
explains a verbal report of felt purpose.

Stimulus Control and
Knowledge

All behavior, whether induced or operant, occurs in a certain context.
I salivate when I sit down to dinner, and less so at other times. With
such induced behavior, the context is the set of environmental circum­
stances that induce it (the dining room, the set table, the smell and
sight of the food). Species-specific responses to food, predators, poten­
tial mates, and other phylogenetically important events are induced
by the contexts in which these events are likely. In the context of the
silhouette of a hawk passing overhead, quail crouch; otherwise they
go about their business.
Operant behavior, too, occurs only within a context. The laboratory
rat trained to press a lever does so only in the experimental chamber.
When placed in the chamber, the experienced rat goes immediately
to the lever and starts pressing. I carry my umbrella only when the
weather looks threatening. I drive to work only on weekdays.
Up to now, we have made only passing mention of context. A
history of reinforcement, for example, consists not only of certain
activities resulting in certain consequences, but also of those relations
occurring over and over in a certain context. "Complying with a threat"
has no meaning apart from its context - the presence of the threat,
the raised voice, the raised fist, the gun. To see how behaviorists can
offer a scientific account of what it means to know something, without
resorting to mentalism, we need to Understand and then to apply the
concepts that behavior analysts use to explain the effects of context.
As we will see, to know something is to behave in context.

demonstration, the red and green key lights are discriminative stimuli
because key-pecks can be reinforced only in the context of the red key
and cannot be reinforced in the context of the green key. As a result of
the difference in reinforcement relations from one context to the other,
pecks are more likely when the light is red.
Even in the laboratory, more complicated discriminative stimuli
are cornmon. Suppose I have two keys side by side for the pigeon to
peck, and either key can be lit either red or green. I can train the
pigeon to peck at a green key when it is presented along with a red
key, and regardless of whether the green key is on the left or the right,
by reinforcing only pecks at the green key. In an experiment like this,
the discriminative stimulus for pecking is " green key, regardless of
position." In the task called matching to sample, the pigeon is presented
with a sample stimulus (e.g., red or green) on a center key and choice
stimuli (red and green) on two keys on either side of the sample key.
Only pecks at the side key that matches the sample are reinforced.
The discriminative stimuli controlling pecking in matching to sample
are compounds, such as fIred sample plus red side key" and " green
sample plus green side key."
In the world outside the laboratory, discriminative stimuli are usu­
ally compound like this. If you are driving on a two-lane road and
come up behind a slow-moving vehicle, you only pass when the center
line is broken on your side and there are no oncoming cars ahead in
the opposite lane. The discriminative stimulus (context) for passing
consists of at least three elements: (1) the slow-moving vehicle ahead,
(2) the broken center line, and (3) the clear opposite lane. If any one of
those elements were absent, you would be unlikely to pass. The com­
bination sets the context; the combination defines the discriminative
stimulus in the presence of which the operant behavior (passing) is
likely to be reinforced.
In still more complicated contexts, part of the context or discriminat­
ive stimulus may have occurred some time before the occasion for
the behavior. In a matching-to-sample experiment, the sample can be
presented to the pigeon and turned off several seconds before the
choice keys are turned on. Even though the sample is no longer present,
pigeons still peck the matching side key. Human beings can bridge
much longer time gaps. If I tell you on Monday I will meet you in my
office at three o'clock on Friday, your behavior of going to my office
depends on (1) its being Friday, (2) its being three o'clock, and (3)
what I said on Monday. All three elements are required for your going
to my office to be likely to occur and to be reinforced, but one of those
elements was only present four days earlier. (See chapter 5 for more
discussion of time gaps.)

Behavior changes as context changes. I stop when the traffic light is
red and go when it is green. My stopping and going are under stimulus
control. Here, stimulus means " context," and control means " changes
the frequency or likelihood of one or more activities."
I have often shown students a classroom demonstration in which
a pigeon has been trained to peck at a red key and not to peck at a
green key. In the first step of training, the key is lit red, and every peck
operates the food dispenser. The number of pecks required to produce
food is gradually increased to 1 5 pecks. The second step of training
introduces the green key, with the contingency that if two seconds go
by without a peck, food is made available. At first, the pigeon pecks at
the green key without success. Sooner or later it pauses long enough
for the food to be presented. As it pauses more and pecks less, the pause
required for food is gradually lengthened to ten seconds. At the end of
training, in the demonstration, I control the color of the key by a switch
on the apparatus. As long as the key is lit red, the pigeon pecks rapidly.
As soon as I switch the color to green, the pigeon ceases pecking.
When I switch back to red, the pigeon starts pecking again. As I switch
the color back and forth, the pecking switches on and off with it.
The demonstration illustrates stimulus control. The red and green
colors on the key control the pecking in the sense that changing the
color changes the likelihood of pecking.
Behavior analysts usually distinguish stimulus control from stimulus­
response elicitation. When the traffic light turns green, my going
becomes likely, but I am not compelled to go the way I am compelled
to sneeze when my nose is tickled. Changing context affects operant
behavior more like modulation than compulsion.
Most important, elicited or induced behavior appears to depend on
context alone (if an itch in the nose can be called a context), whereas
operant behavior depends on consequences occurring in a certain
context - that is, it depends on the combination of consequences and
context. The itch-context by itself suffices to make sneezing likely; in
the pigeon demonstration, pecks become likely in the context of the
red key because pecks produce food only in the context of the red key.

Discriminative Stimuli
To distinguish it from stimuli that elicit or induce behavior, the context
of operant behavior is called a discriminative stimulus. In the pigeon

A Scientific Model of Behavior

Extended Sequences and Discriminative Stimuli
Although often in life the parts of an activity may occur in any order
- in cooking, I may first put in salt and then pepper. or the other way
around - sometimes the parts of an activity must occur in a definite
sequence for it to be successful (reinforced). Progress may even be
impossible in the absence of a certain object or condition. If I have
no car, I must rent or borrow one before I can go to the beach. Your
friend must be invited before you can go to a movie together. Other
times, we create conditions in which reinforcement is more likely than
otherwise. I put gas in the car before going on a trip, increasing the
likelihood of getting to my destination without needing gas. Some­
times the sequences are long. A college student goes to classes so as to
prepare for exams, so as to succeed in courses, so as to graduate after
four years. Whenever the parts must occur in a certain sequence, the
earlier part produces the environmental conditions required for the
next part.
These cues to progress (car, willing friend, gas gauge at full) that set
the occasion or context for the next activity are called discriminative
s timuli. The gas gauge reading full serves as a discriminative stimulus
for further operant behavior (going on the trip) that only occurs in
its presence. In addition, behavior analysts often consider such a dis­
criminative stimulus to function as a reinforcer. You go to the gas
station to fill the tank, and if that gas station should close, you stop
going there. The earlier activity (going to the gas station) depends
upon its outcome in much the same way that opening the refrigerator
when you are hungry depends on the outcome of eating. Thus, the
result of putting gas in the car - gas gauge reading full - serves two
functions. On the one hand, the gauge reading serves'as a discriminat­
ive stimulus for the next activity in the sequence (going on the trip).
On the other hand, the gauge reading serves as an interim conditional
reinforcer for the operant behavior (going to the gas station) that pro­
duces it. The exact nature of such reinforcers is a matter of controversy,
but that need not detain us here; without going into theoretical sub­
tleties, we will treat the behavior-produced stimulus as a reinforcer.
In the laboratory, we can train a rat to pull on a ring to turn on a
light in the presence of which pressing on a lever is reinforced with
food. We begin by training the rat to press the lever by arranging for
each press to operate a dispenser containing food pellets. Next, we
reinforce the presses only when a light above the lever is lit, turning
the light off and on every minute or so. After an hour or two, the light
is established as a discriminative stimulus - presses are frequent when

111

it is on and rare when it is off. Then we leave the light off, and sus­
pend the ring from the center of the chamber. We wait until the rat
approaches the ring, turn the light on, and let the rat press the lever
and get food. When the light is again turned off, the rat returns to the
ring, and a pull on the ring is required before the light will turn on.
Before long, the sequence of pulling the ring followed by pressing
the lever is occurring regularly. The light coming on both reinforces
ring-pulling and sets the occasion for lever-pressing.
When sequences are held together by the reinforcer for one activity
serving as the discriminative stimulus for the next, the sequence is
known as a behavioral chain. The "links" in the chain are the activities
performed one after the other. The links are joined together by the
changes in context - the discriminative stimuli. Behavioral chains are
meant to be a laboratory model of behavioral sequencing in the every­
day world. They model a part of the way activities are put together;
in the everyday world, some parts of an activity may need to occur
early, but other parts may occur in any order. A student may need to
prepare for both an upcoming history test and an upcoming psycho­
logy test; the preparation must occur before the tests, but the order of
preparing the two subjects may be unimportant.
Whether sequence matters or not, the whole activity is maintained
by ultimate reinforcers that occur after most or all of the parts have
been completed. The college student prepares for exams and takes
them, producing good exam grades, which ultimately add up to good
course grades, which ultimately lead to graduation. If graduation some­
how becomes impossible, the student will be unlikely to continue
performing in the courses. In our laboratory example, if the food is
discontinued, both ring-pulling and lever-pressing cease. The light loses
its abilities both as a reinforcer and as a discriminative stimulus. When
American continentals lost their value as currency, they not only ceased
to work as reinforcers, but having them in hand also ceased to serve as
the context (discriminative stimulus) for the further operant behavior
of going to shops. If the weather is rainy and cold, I do not put gas in
the car for a trip to the seashore; the full tank only serves as a reinforcer
and discriminative stimulus if the weather is fine.

Discrimination
When behavior changes as context changes, behavior analysts call
that regularity a discrimination. In the rat experiment, the change from
light off to light on depended on the rat's pulling the ring, whereas in
the pigeon demonstration, the pigeon's behavior in no way affected

1 13

A Scientific Model of Behavior

Stimulus Control and Knowledge

the change from red to green key (I switched the color). Either way,
whether stimuli change in a sequence or whether stimuli change
regardless of behavior, the change in behavior with the change in dis­
criminative stimuli constitutes a discrimination. When behavior shifts
from working to visiting the mall as a result of the. shift from being
broke to having money, that is a chain and a discrimination. When
behavior shifts as day turns to night, that is not a chain, but it is a
discrimination.
Since discrimination means a change of behavior with a change of
stimuli, every discrimination involves at least two stimulus conditions
- two contexts. In the simplest laboratory example, lever-pressing
occurs when the light is on - one discriminative stimulus and not
when the light is off - a second discriminative stimulus. If Naomi
behaves differently with her parents and her peers, we say that she
discriminates between these two contexts or discriminative stimuli
parents and peers.
Every discrimination results from a history. If unlearned, it results
from an evolutionary history. A baby quail behaves differently in the
presence of a hawk than in its absence because of phylogeny. If learned,
the discrimination arises from a history of reinforcement. A rat presses
a lever when a light is on and not when it is off because lever-presses
have been reinforced when the light was on and not when the light
was off. I visit the store when I have money and not when I am broke
because going to the store was reinforced when I had money and not
when I was broke. In general, one activity occurs in the presence of
one discriminative stimulus and another activity in the presence of
another discriminative stimulus because the one activity is reinforced
in the one context and the other activity in the other context.
That is the whole explanation: Discrimination arises from history.
Nothing mental - usually nothing even private - figures into the
account. To be most accurate, we should say that the organism's
behavior contains a pattern of discrimination, or that the behavior
discriminates, but often the organism is said to discriminate. If we say
that a rat discriminates between the presence and absence of a light,
we imagine no inner event inside the rat. If, for example, someone
were to say that the rat discriminates because it "attends" to the light,
we might point out that the attending adds nothing to the account
because it only restates the observation that behavior changes when
the light is turned on and off. It is an example of mentalism.
S timulus control means that a stimulus exerts control over behavior
- that behavior changes in its presence. It would be incorrect to say
that the stimulus exerts control over the rat or person, because then
the rat or person would have to engage in some ghostly mental action,

like attending, to go from the stimulus to the behavior. The idea in
stimulus control is that the stimulus affects the behavior directly.
Discrimination refers only to the change in behavior with the change
of context. It would be incorrect to say that the rat discriminates and
presses only when the light is on or that the rat presses then because
it discriminates. "The rat discriminates" or "The light is a discrimin­
ative stimulus" means only that the frequency or likelihood of lever­
pressing changes when the light is turned on and off. Likewise, " Naomi
discriminates between parents and peers" means only that Naomi's
behavior is different in those two contexts. In other words, to think of
discrimination as a private event that precedes and then causes the
public change in behavior would be a mistake. In general, discrimina­
tion is never a private event; the one exception lies in the way some
behavior analysts treat self-knowledge, which we will come to shortly.

Knowledge
Everyday talk about knowledge is mentalistic. A person is said to
possess knowledge of French and to display it by speaking and under­
standing French. A rat is said to press a lever because it knows that
pressing produces food. As with purpose and intending (chapter 5),
knowledge and knowing in no way explain the behavior that sup­
posedly results from them. What is knowledge of French that it is
"displayed" when I speak French? Where is it, and what is it made of
that it could cause the speaking of French? As with all mental entities,
it seems to be some ghostly thing hidden away inside, invented as
an attempt at explanation, but really saying nothing beyond what is
already observed: that the person speaks and understands French.
How does the rat " know" about pressing and food? Does saying it
knows say anything but that in the past presses have produced food
in this situation?
Rather than taking knowledge and knowing as explanations of beha­
vior, behaviorists analyze these terms by focusing on the conditions
under which they occur. When are people likely to say that someone
"has knowledge" or "knows something"?
Philosophers and psychologists commonly divide knowledge into
procedural and declarative: "knowing how" and "knowing about." A
great deal has been written about the distinction, speculating about
imagined inner schemes and meanings that might underlie it. To the
behaviorist, if the distinction is useful at all, it must be based on
behavior and environment, externals available to any observer.

Stimulus Control and Knowledge

Tradition also distinguishes between other people's knowledge and
one's own knowledge, particularly self-knowledge one's own know­
ledge of oneself. Traditionally, many thinkers supposed that, because
I am specially privy to all my doings, public and private, in a way that
I cannot be privy to anyone else's doings, self-knowledge must be
somehow special. Indeed, philosophers have often asserted that only
self-knowledge can be certain (or "incorrigible"), because all know­
ledge in others can only be based on inference. Supposedly, I can know
for sure that I know French, whereas Zack's knowledge of French is
for me only an inference based on the observation of his speaking and
understanding French. Since the division between self and other cuts
across the distinction between procedural and declarative knowledge,
we will take up procedural and declarative knowledge in self and
others and then turn to self-knowledge in particular.
-

Procedural Knowledge: KnOwing How
Figure 6.1 summarizes the four types of knowing and the tests that
lead to speaking of knowing or knowledge. The first column treats
procedural knowled ge. When do we say that Gideon knows how to
swim? When we see him swimming. The test of Gideon's knowledge
is whether he has ever been seen swimming. To say that he knows
how to swim means simply that he does swim.
Similarly, when do I say I know how to swim? When I have swum.
The test of my knowledge parallels the test of Gideon's knowledge:
whether I have ever observed myself swimming. To say that I know
how to swim means simply that I do swim.
Ryle, whose views we discussed in chapter 3, treated knowing and
knowledge as dispositions or category labels. Knowing French, for
example, is a complex example of knowing how. We can list various
actions that might result in saying, "Zack knows French" :
1. Zack responds in French when addressed in French.
2. He reacts appropriately when he receives a telegram written in
French.

3 . He laughs and cries at the right places in a French movie.
4. He translates from French into English and English into French.
5. He reads French newspapers and discusses the news afterwards.

This list could be expanded indefinitely, because the category of
actions that comprises "knowing French" is indefinitely large. In chap­
ter 3, we saw that some philosophers considered this a flaw in Ryle's
argument. However, in practice, when people talk of knowledge and
knowing, the list of evidence actually considered is fairly short. Once
we have seen several French-knowing actions, we guess that any
number of others are possible, and we say, "Zack knows French."
The category may be thought of also as a behavioral disposition. Zack
is said to know French even when he is not speaking it, even when he
is asleep. The meaning of the statement resembles the meaning of the
statement "Shona is a smoker." Shona smokes only some of the time
and never when asleep; she is said to be a smoker because she smokes
often enough. Similarly, "Gideon knows how to swim" means he swims
sometimes, and "Zack knows French" means that he acts occasionally
in some of the ways that occasion talk of "knowing French."
A person asserts "I know French" or "I know how to swim" for
much the same reasons as the statements might be made about Zack
and Gideon. The means by which I observe myself swimming are a bit
different. Whereas I see Gideon swimming, I rarely see myself swim,
except in a home movie, but I feel it and see the vvater and some of my
body moving, and other people tell me I was swimming. Similarly, with
speaking French: I hear myself, observe myself reading, and so on.
All these events, whether of Gideon swimming or of myself swim­
ming, stand in relation to my saying that Gideon knows or I know
how to swim as discriminative stimuli stand in relation to operant
behavior. As the rat is likely to press the lever only when the light is
on, so I am likely to say, "Gideon knows how to swim," only after
having seen him swim. Similarly, I am likely to say " I know how to
swim" only after the stimuli associated with that have occurred. Just
as with the rat's lever-pressing, my utterances of this sort must have
been reinforced in the past by people around me. Chapter 7 will
go more deeply into verbal behavior; for now, the point to bear in
mind is that utterances such as "Zack knows X" and " I know X" are
examples of operant behavior under stimulus control.
Our shorthand name for such utterances under the control of envir­
onmental context will be "verbal reports." "Zack knows French" or " I
know French" i s a verbal report under the control of French-knowing
events and arises from a long history of reinforcement for making
such verbal reports.

1 16

A Scientific Model of Behavior

Declarative Knowledge: Knowing About
Knowing about differs from knowing how only in that it adds
stimulus control. When do we say, "The rat knows about the light" or
"Aaron knows about birds"? The rat is said to know about the light if
it responds more when the light is on. Aaron is said to know about
birds if he correctly names various specimens, explains their nesting
habits, imitates their songs, and so on. The conditions for these utter­
ances are a bit different than for knowing-how utterances, because the
behavior comprised in knowing about must be appropriate to some
discriminative stimulus or some category of discriminative stimuli.
The thing known about is the discriminative stimulus or the category.

Declarative knowledge and stimulus control
Figure 6.1 indicates that the test of knowing about is appropriate
response to a discriminative stimulus. If I claim to know about the
American Civil War, you might test that claim by asking me questions
like "Why do you suppose Pickett didn't argue with Lee instead of
going ahead with his charge at Gettysburg?" or "What did Grant do
when Lee arrived at Appomattox Court House?" If I can give you
answers that agree with other things you have heard and read, your
saying that I know about the Civil War will become more likely. The
more 1 talk about it, the more likely you will be to say that 1 know.
My utterances are operant behavior under the stimulus control of you
and your questions. Figure 6.1 suggests also that my original claim to
know has a similar basis. My own behavior of talking and answering
questions about the Civil War constitute the context (discriminative
stimulus) that controls my saying "I know about the Civil War." If 1
had no answers for your questions, 1 might be inclined to take it back
or say 1 know a little about the Civil War. The only difference between
my test and your test is that your test is probably based on a smaller
sample of my behavior than my test.
All of this leaves open an important question: How do we decide
whether the knOWing-about behavior is "appropriate"? Going back to
our simplest example, we might say the rat knows about the light if
more lever-presses occur when the light is on. The lever-presses are
appropriate because they have been reinforced in the presence of the
light in the past. Similarly, my talking about the Civil War in response
to questions has been reinforced in the past; in particular, my correct
responses were reinforced and my incorrect responses were punished.
Appropriate turns out to mean "reinforced and not punished. "

Stimulus Control and Knowledge

1 17

Pigeons have been taught not only to peck at a red key and not at a
green, but also to peck at slides containing pictures of human beings
and not to peck at slides containing no human being ( Herrnstein and
Loveland, 1964). The slides containing humans constitute a category
of discriminative stimuli that controls the pigeons' pecking. Since they
peck only at the slides with people, we could reasonably say that the
pigeons know about people in slides. We say this even though they
cannot talk. Their "knowledge" is "displayed" in their pecking. They
peck appropriately - they discriminate, or peck when their pecks may
be reinforced and not when they will not be - and that is the context
for our saying they "know about."
Once we understand that discrimination and reinforcement are the
observations that set the occasion for our talking of knowing about,
we have two choices. We may go on talking about knowing about,
while admitting that it really only means "discrimination and rein­
forcement," or we may stop talking that way and talk about discrimina­
tion and reinforcement instead. When trying to be precise, behavior
analysts use the technical terms because mentalistic talk about know­
ledge usually results in confusion.

What is a lie ?
For example, some philosophers and zoologists argue that if a non­
human creature can be shown to deceive one of its comrades, then the
creature must have consciousness (Cheney and Seyfarth, 1990). The
following type of example is offered as evidence. A dominant monkey
and a subordinate were in a conflict. The subordinate made an alarm
call that would normally accompany sighting a predator, but no pre­
dator was present. As a result, the dominant monkey fled. These
theorists consider that the threatened monkey must have privately put
itself in the other monkey's place, knowing from its own past behavior
that the dominant monkey would flee when it heard the alarm call.
Thus, they say, the subordinate monkey lied to the dominant monkey
by making the alarm call even though it knew there was no predator.
What is wrong with such an explanation?
The behaviorist approaches the question "What is a lie?" by asking
under what conditions people are likely to say that someone is telling
a lie. People try to distinguish between a lie and a mistake. They
commonly say that the two differ in that lying is done "on purpose."
In chapter 5, we saw that one way to understand doing on purpose is
to relate the activity to a history of reinforcement. If Shona tells you
that the post office is on Congress Street, and you find it is really on

1 18

A Scientific Model of Behavior

Daniel Street, you guess that she simply made a mistake, because
you see no reason (i.e., no reinforcer) for her telling you the wrong
street. If, however, the post office was about to close for the day, and
you were rushing to mail an entry into a contest in which you and
Shona were both competing, you might suspect Shona of telling
you the wrong street "on purpose," because her doing so might be
reinforced.
The first condition that makes it likely to say someone is lying,
then, is reinforcement for the action. Lying is operant behavior. Prob­
ably every child lies at some time. Whether the child's lying becomes
common depends on the consequences, whether it is reinforced or
punished. The reinforcer for lying is often avoiding punishment ("Did
you eat that cookie?" "No, I never touched it"), sometimes gaining a
reward ("Have you had any sweets today?" " No, none all day." "Good,
then you may have dessert"). The monkey that was said to have lied
made an alarm call that was reinforced by the removal of the threaten­
ing dominant monkey.
The second condition for calling an action a lie is inconsistency. You
may have no idea of a person's motives (i.e., of the reinforcers) for the
lie, but if Gideon tells you one day that he saw a robbery, and tells
you the next day that he saw no robbery, you become likely to say he
is now lying. You will be particularly likely to say this if he has been
acting in several ways consistent with his having seen the robbery having acted fearful, having related the events, having described the
robber, and so on. As we saw in chapter 3, Ryle would say that all of
these belong in the same behavioral category, and a molar behavior­
ist would say all of these are parts of the same extended activity
"witnessing the robbery." The behavior that is inconsistent with the
category or activity - the denial in our example - is called a lie. The
alarm-calling monkey was probably said to have lied on grounds of
inconsistency also, because the researchers had observed it to call on
other occasions when a predator was present. Since the other mon­
keys quickly learn to ignore umeliable callers (i.e., discriminate on the
basis of who is calling), reinforcement for the deceptive alarm-calling
must soon disappear.
One question remains: Where did the deceptive alarm call come
from in the first place? The temptation to mentalism arises just from
the absence of this information. As we saw in chapter 5, when we are
ignorant of the history of reinforcement, making up stories about
ghostly inner origins is no help. Most likely, the subordinate monkey
made alarm calls on earlier occasions when a predator was present,
and on some of those occasions the calling was reinforced by the
removal of the dominant monkey. It may have been a small step to

Public versus private stimuli
If we ask about public and private stimuli, the first point to recog­
nize is that only public stimuli are normally available to significant
others in a growing child's environment. The verbal reports of a child
(operant behavior, remember!) are reinforced by those significant
others. Reinforcing appropriate verbal reports, like naming objects or
colors, is relatively easy when the stimuli are public. The child says,
"Dog," and the parent says, "Yes, that's right, that's a dog." "What
color is this ball?" " Red." "Yes, wonderful, that's right."
Special problems arise when we try to teach the child to report on
private events, because these are unavailable to significant others
to set the context for reinforcement. We focus earlier on those that
allow reasonable guesses because of collateral public cues - pain, for
example. We see the child crying. "Did you hurt yourself?" A "Yes" is
followed by sympathy and care-giving (reinforcers), but also by "Where
does it hurt? Did you bump your knee?" Visible signs of an injury
may help. If we put together training to name parts of the body with
questions about hurting, we eventually manage to train the child to
make verbal reports of the general form " My X hurts."
Training someone to report on private events without such reliable
public accompaniments is much harder. That is why "getting in touch

120

A Scientific Model of Behavior

with your feelings" seems to be so slow and difficult. Am I angry
or afraid? Am I doing this out of love or guilt? These are difficult
judgments.
Their difficulty arises, however, not from lack of information, but
from uncertainty about how to interpret the information. Restated in
technical language, the difficulty arises not from any lack of discrim­
inative stimuli - public, private, past, and present - but from lack of
an adequate history of reinforcement for the discrimination between
one stimulus and the other. The lack of the history of reinforcement
results from the lack of public cues to control the behavior of those
around who might reinforce the correct verbal report. If public dis­
criminative stimuli could indicate whether you were angry or afraid ­
say, you turned red for the one and green for the other - then you
would have no difficulty saying whether you were afraid or angry
because people around you would have no difficulty reinforcing the
correct verbal report. The actual public cues, however, are complex
and unreliable. Only someone with unusual training can tell fear from
anger with certainty. That is why the therapist who helps you to "get
in touch with your feelings" may be able to tell you how you feel fearful, angry, loving, or guilty - better than you can yourself.
Thus, our situation is exactly the reverse of the conventional view:
private events are less well known than public events (Skinner, 1969).
Since verbal reports, like other operant behavior, depend on reliable
reinforcement, and reliable reinforcement depends on public cues for
others to deliver the reinforcement, verbal reports occur readily only
in the presence of public cues. The so-called " raw feels" (e.g., pain)
spoken of by philosophers are just those private events more likely to
be accompanied by public cues (writhing) that allow verbal reports of
them to be reinforced consistently by others.
Whether learned readily or with difficulty, verbal reports based partly
on private stimuli can be learned only if accompanied by cues, how­
ever subtle or unreliable, that are public. As with other forms of know­
ledge, the public cues that control the verbal reports that constitute
my self-knowledge are much the same ones that control other people's
verbal reports that constitute their knowledge about me. I know that I
am angry in much the same way that someone else knows that I am
angry: Here is a situation in which people in general behave angrily,
in which I have behaved angrily in the past, and in which I have an
angry expression, a red face, and clenched fists. The only difference,
of course, is that I may also be able to report angry thoughts and
tightness in my chest. Someone else, however, might notice my angry
expression and red face when I cannot. The stimuli that control my
verbal report about myself may differ from those that control someone

else's verbal report about me, but they are neither necessarily more
abundant nor necessarily more reliable.
This idea that self-knowledge depends on the same sorts of public
observations as knowledge about others flies in the face of the conven­
tional view that self-knowledge depends on privileged information
unavailable to others. It has some laboratory research to support it,
however. Daryl Bern (1967) and his students, for example, conducted
several experiments that tested whether people's self-perceptions might
be under the control of their own public behavior. In the late 1950s,
a psychologist named Leon Festinger put forward a theory about
self-perception called dissonance theory. Since it was supposed to
explain people's attributions about themselves - that is, their responses
to questions about their beliefs and attitudes, usually on paper-and­
pencil tests - dissonance theory quickly became part of more general
attribution theory. It stemmed from observations that if experimental
subjects could be persuaded without any good excuse to say things
with which they initially disagreed, their attributions would change
afterwards to be more in keeping with what they had said. For example,
in one experiment subjects first participated in two boring tasks and
then were asked to lie to a woman waiting in another room (actually a
confederate in the experiment), telling her that the tasks were fun and
interesting. Half the subjects were paid a dollar to do this, and half
were paid $20 to do this. Subsequently, when the subjects filled out a
questionnaire, the ones that were paid only a dollar rated the tasks as
interesting, whereas the subjects paid $20 and a comparison group
that had not lied rated the tasks as boring. According to dissonance
theory, the subjects paid only a dollar changed their self-perceptions
because they experienced a need to reduce the dissonance between
their inner knowledge that the tasks were boring and their outer
behavior of saying the tasks were interesting.
Bern argued against this mentalistic theory. He suggested that the
subjects simply observed their own behavior as they would another
person's and concluded that the things said by a person paid only a
dollar were more likely to be true than those said by the person paid
$20. For one of his experiments, Bern created a tape-recording that
could have been one of the original subjects lying convincingly to the
confederate, who responded politely. All of Bern's subjects listened
to a description of the tasks and to the recording. They were then
divided into three groups, one group told nothing, one group told that
the speaker was paid a dollar, and one group told that the speaker
was paid $20. On a questionnaire that they filled out afterwards, they
rated the tasks as to whether they were interesting or boring, as had
been done in the dissonance study. The results were the same as in the

122

A Scientific Mod el of Behavior

dissonance study, except, of course,
the ratings (attributions) were
based now on observations of ano
ther person instead of oneself. Bem
concluded that the person who is paid
less is more credible, regardless
of whether it happens to be someon
e else or oneself.
Like other forms of mentalism, diss
onance theory only distracts us
from the ultimate explanation of
jud gments of credibility, our earl
ier
social experience. Just as our dem
onstration pigeons discriminate
between a red key and a green key
, most people discriminate between
people who are paid to say things
and people who are not. Like the
pigeons, people discriminate as a
result of a history of reinforcement
depending on context. Behavior in
accordance with the utterances of
people who are paid is less likely
to be reinforced. We are more apt
to
act in accord with the utterances
of a person who is not paid. In the
molar behaviorist's (or Ryle's) term
s, we are more apt to display those
actions that belong to the activity
(or category) "believing what the
person said." In these experiments
, it made little difference whether
the unpaid liar was another person
or oneself.
Self-knowledge about beliefs and
attitudes often depends on dis­
criminations that involve many eve
nts over long periods, but the events
are more public than private. The
parent who wonders whether he
or she spends time with a chil
d because of love or guilt is said
to
be wondering about motives. Mo
tives, of course, are mental fictions
.
Where do these Supposed motives
come from? Discriminating whether
I act out of love or gui lt requires
access to the history of reinforceme
nt
for the behavior. Is it a history of
positive or negative reinforceme
nt?
Do I spend time with my child bec
ause in the past my wife threaten
ed
disapproval and withdrawal of
affection if I did not? Or do I spe
nd
time with my child because in
the past my child and my wife
have
reinforced the behavior with hug
s, kisses, and other tokens of affe
ction?
If we say a therapist knows the diff
erence between your guilt and you
r
love better than you yourself do,
it is because the therapist is bett
er
able to discriminate the one hist
ory of reinforcement from the oth
er.

Introspection
Conventional ideas about self-kn
owledge are tied closely to the not
ion
of introspection. According to this
idea, one acquires self-knowledg
e by
looking within the theater of the
mind to see what thoughts, idea
s,
perceptions, and sensations mig
ht be there. In chapter 3 we review
ed
some of the problems with not
ions like this - that the mind has
no
place in the natural world, that who
does the looking or how is unclear
,
and so on.

Stimulus Control and Knowledge

123

Ryle's account of self-knowledge differs from Skinner's only in the
criticisms of introspection. Ryle rejects introspection on logical grounds.
" Observing a robin" is a label for the category of behavior that includes
ta lking about the robin, pointing to it, describing it, mentioning when
it moves, and so on. When you observe a robin, you do not do two
things, observe it and talk about it, because logically all that is meant
by observing a robin is that you do things like talk about it. Observing
a thought seems to imply just what observing a robin does not, that
the observing is some second behavior distinct from the thought. If
that were true, then we should be able to observe ourselves observing,
observe ourselves observing ourselves observing, and so on. In other
words, the idea of introspection leads to an infinite regress, an outcome
that is generally considered absurd. As with seeing the robin, talking
about a thought is just part of thinking the thought.
Skinner takes the more pragmatic approach of looking for the cir­
cumstances under which someone might speak of introspection. If
observing a thought were like observing a robin, then we would talk
about the thought as we would talk about the robin. Talk about one's
own behavior, particularly about one's private behavior, seems to be
the occasion on which people might say someone is introspecting.
Accordingly, Skinner focuses on the verbal report. The only difference
between a verbal report about a robin and a verbal report about
a thought is that the discriminative stimulus is entirely public for
the robin and partly private for the thought. Both verbal reports are
examples of operant behavior under stimulus control. We will examine
how it is possible to treat verbal reports this way in chapter 7.

The Behavior of Scientists
Since a scientist is a behaving organism, we should expect that the
concepts of behavior analysis would apply to the behavior of scientists
as much as to anyone else. We can reasonably ask, "What are the
activities that someone must engage in to be called a 'scientist'?" Those
activities should be understandable in the light of our concepts of
operant behavior and stimulus control.

Observation and Discrimination
The physicist Ernst Mach and other writers have pointed out that the
activities of science are the same as some activities of everyday life,

A Scientific Model of Behavior

Stimulus Control and Knowledge

only done with more care and precision. Scientists are said to gather
data, which is to say they make unusually careful and precise observa­
tions, often with the aid of special instruments. In nonexperimental
sciences like astronomy, observation is the whole of data gathering,
and new observations often occur by luck. In experimental sciences,
special environments are built and manipulated. An experiment con­
sists of manipulation combined with observation.
In the technical vocabulary of behavior analysis, scientific observa­
tion is the forming of discriminations. One of the most basic activities
of science is naming. The astronomer looks at a star and says, That is a
red giant. The biologist looks at a shape in a cell body and says, That is
a mitochondrion. Similarly, measurement consists of saying or writing
something (operant behavior) as a result of looking at or listening to
some instrument (discriminative stimulus). The chemist reads a meter
and writes "32 degrees" in a notebook. The behavior analyst reads a
counter and writes "528 lever-presses." Analysis of data, too, consists
of fonning discriminations. We manipulate numbers in the form of
tables and graphs, looking for patterns, finally drawing conclusions,
spoken and written. The physicist sees that the points in a graph fall
close to a line and says, These numbers conform to Boyle's law. A socio­
logist calculates a correlation coefficient and says, Family violence
increases in times of economic hardship.
All these discriminations share a special feature: The scientist not
only makes the discrimination, based on the shape, counter-reading,
or pattern of numbers, but also behaves so as to produce the dis­
criminative stimulus. This combination of activities, producing stimuli
and discriminating on the basis of the stimuli produced, prompts
people to call science " creative." We manipulate instruments again
and again, looking for some reCOgnizable discriminative stimulus, until
finally something can be said or written: There, now you can see it is a
mitochondrion or Now it is clear that the points lie along this line, not that
one or If you pick out these numbers and those, there is an increasing trend.
Scientists are especially rewarded for making novel discriminations,
which are called " discoveries." Nobel prizes are given for discrimina­
tions like The structure of the DNA molecule is a double helix or This is a
vaccine that prevents polio.

paleontologist announces the discovery of a fossil of a new species of
dinosaur, other paleontologists ask many questions. How can you be
sure it's not this other species? How good are your measurements?
Could your estimate of the age of the fossil be incorrect? Aren't those
shapes actually feathers? The person's ability to supply adequate
answers determines whether the discovery is accepted. In behavior­
analytic terms, the scientist's answers serve as a discriminative stimulus
for others to say that he or she knows something. If enough scientists
begin to say this, the discovery becomes part of the common know­
ledge - part of the speaking and writing - of that group of scientists.
Scientific knowledge is the speaking and writing of scientists in scien­
tific contexts.
The main point involved here is that scientists are behaving organ­
isms and that science is a type of operant behavior that, like other
operant behavior, is under the control of context and consequences.
Speaking, writing, doing experiments, making measurements - all are
types of operant behavior under control of context and consequences.
If the paleontologist's answers to questions persuade other paleonto­
logists, they reinforce the speaking and writing about the discovery. If
too many others reject the " discovery," or fail to reinforce the speak­
ing and writing and even punish it, then the " discoverer" may eventu­
ally change his or her behavior, and give up or take back the claim.
Or, the would-be discoverer's speaking and writing may persist for a
time in the face of nonreinforcement. The persistence may eventually
pay off, but some scientists have gone to their graves upholding an
idea that was never accepted. Why some persist and others give up in
the face of little or no reinforcement for their behavior remains to be
understood, but the answer will most likely be found in individual
histories of reinforcement.

1 24

Scientific Knowledge
Scientific knowledge is a type of declarative knowledge or knOWing
about. A scientist is said to know about something when he or she
can speak (and particularly answer questions) correctly in context. If a

1 25

Pragmatism and Contextualism
The view that scientists are behaving organisms, that science is operant
behavior, and that scientific knowledge consists of the speaking and
writing of scientists, all under the control of context and consequences,
conflicts with the realist's view of science we discussed in chapter 2. It
says nothing about a real world, nothing about " sense data," nothing
about ultimate truth.
Instead, as chapter 2 suggested, the behavior-analytic view of science
follows in the tradition of pragmatism. Pragmatists like William James
hold that the truth of a scientific theory lies in its usefulness. To the
behavior analyst, this translates into The likelihood ofpatterns of speaking

126

A Scientific Model of Behavior

and writing depends on their reinforcement. Talk about a flat earth per­
sisted as long as it was reinforced by listeners and practical outcomes.
It ceased when listeners ceased to reinforce it and instead began rein­
forcing talk about a round earth. Round-earth talk was more rein­
forced by practical outcomes than flat-earth talk. In other words, the
round-earth theory was considered "true" when it became socially
acceptable and was recognized to be more useful in practical activities
like navigating a ship.
The behavior-analytic view resembles an idea that historians of sci­
ence call contextu alism. According to contextualism, scientific theories
and research must be understood within the context of their time
and culture. It rejects the view of science as objective and value-free.
Instead, contextualists assert that the theories and even the experi­
ments that scientists come up with depend on the cultural environment
in which they live and grew up. Contextualists consider it no acciden
t
that the theory of evolution was proposed and eventually accepte
d at
the same time that the Industrial Revolution was proceeding.
The behavior-analytic view agrees with contextualism in a genera
l
way, but goes beyond it, emphasizing practical consequences in
addition to social consequences, and specifying the means by which
the social environment (i.e., other people in the group, or the verbal
community, as we will see in chapter 7) shapes science. The behavi
or
of scientists, speaking and writing, like the operant behavior of other
organisms, is shaped by reinforcement and punishment.

Summary
People speak of " knowing" and "knowledge" when a person or other
creature behaves with respect to the natural world, public and private,
in ways that are reinforced (are " appropriate"). Procedural knowledge
or knowing how means that some particular behavior or category of
behavior has been observed. "Gideon knows how to swim" means
that Gideon sometimes swims. " I know how to swim" means that I
sometimes swim. Statements about knowing French are similar, except
that the category " knowing French" includes more varied behavior.
Declarative knowledge or knowing about means that the behavior
referred to is under stimulus control. Whereas a rat might be said to
know how to get food by pressing a lever simply because it presses
the lever, it might be said to know about a light if it only presses the
lever when the light is on. Knowing about refers to discrimination.
In the special case of knowing about in which the behavior under

Stimulus Control and Knowledge

1 27

is said to know about
stimulus control is verbal behavior, a person
have been reinforced (are
a subject if the person makes statements that
" correct") under the control of discriminative stimuli in the environ­
ment (talking about birds with birds around), particularly stimuli pro­
vid ed by others, such as questions (e.g., "What color are robins' eggs?").
Sel f-knowledge belongs to the same general category of "talking about
under stimulus control." It is scarce and weak when it concerns private
events, because private discriminative stimuli are inaccessible to the
person's significant others, who train the discriminations that com­
prise declarative knowledge. The result is the opposite of what would
be expected from the conventional view: Public (" external") events
exert better control over behavior (are better known) than private

(" internal") events.
Scientific knowledge consists of the speaking and writing of scientists. It depends both on a context created by research and on its
consequences in the behavior of listeners and readers, usually other
scientists.

Verbal Behavior and
Language

Much of what we discussed in chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6 assumed that
talking is a type of operant behavior. Many people - laypeople, philo­
sophers, linguists, and psychologists - consider speech and language
to be separate and different from other behavior. Indeed, language is
often said to be what separates our species from other species. Behavior
analysts, however, in keeping with their reliance on evolutionary
theory, seek to understand all species and all types of behavior within
the same general framework. They offer an account of speech and
language that cuts across traditional categories, emphasizing the
resemblance of speaking to other types of behavior. In this chapter,
we will see that talking is one type, and not the only type, of verbal
behavior, and that the notion of verbal behavior replaces many tradi­
tional ideas about talking and language.

What Is Verbal Behavior?
Verbal behavior is a type of operant behavior. It belongs to the
larger category of behavior that could be called "communication,"
except that communication suggests a mentalistic theory foreign to the
behavioral point of view. As we will see, the behavioral view would
either redefine communication or replace it with other terms.

Communication
When a bird gives an alarm call and all the other birds in the flock
hide from the predator, we could say that an episode of communication

131

A Scientific Model of Behavior

Verbal Behavior and Language

occurred. In a behavioral view, the example illustrates all that there is
to communication. " Communication" occurs when the behavior of one
organism generates stimuli that affect the behavior of another organism.
The conventional view holds that in communication something
passes from one person to another. By its derivation, communication
means "to make common." What is made common? An idea, a mes­
sage, a meaning. Some psychologists embellish this everyday concep­
tion by adding that an idea is encoded by the sender, passed in code
to the receiver, and then decoded by the receiver, who then possesses
the message.
Like all mentalistic notions, the everyday idea of communication
adds nothing to what we observe and keeps us from gaining a better
understanding. Where is the message? What is it made of? Who does
this encoding and decoding? The message, the encoding, and the
decoding are fictions of some mental world forever beyond our reach.
The calling bird behaves - moves its pharynx and lungs - and this
results in an auditory stimulus that changes the behavior of other
birds within earshot. Adding that the caller sends a message that the
others receive cannot clarify the account. Is it any different when one
person talks to another?

consequence of this action is that Stacy passes the salt. Zack behaves he moves his larynx, lips, tongue, and so on. This generates an aud­
itory stimulus, which Stacy hears. Zack's saying Please pass the salt is
reinforced by his receiving the salt.
We know that Zack's requesting is under the control of that rein­
forcer, because if he were alone, or the potatoes were sufficiently salty,
or the salt were next to his plate, the utterance Please pass the salt
would not occur. Verbal behavior, like other operant behavior, tends
to occur only in the context in which it is likely to be reinforced.

130

Verbal B ehavior As Operant Behavior
Alarm-calling and talking differ in one crucial way. The bird's alarm
call is a fixed action pattern, whereas talking is operant behavior. When
a fixed action pattern generates auditory or visual stimuli that affect
the behavior of others (as in defense, aggression, and courtship), that
event can be called communication. However, it is not verbal behavior.
Even the human eyebrow flash of greeting, although it affects the
person who sees it and therefore is communicative, is not an example
of verbal behavior.
"Communication" is the larger category. All verbal behavior could
be called communication, but the reverse is not true. Fixed action
patterns depend only on antecedents (sign stimuli), whereas verbal
behavior, because it is a type of operant behavior, depends on its
consequences.

Speaking has consequences
Suppose Zack and Stacy are at the table eating, Zack's potatoes lack
salt, and the salt is over by Stacy. Zack says, Please pass the salt. The

The verbal community
Those around who hear and reinforce what a person says are mem­
bers of that person's verbal community - that group of people who
speak to one another and reinforce one another's talking.
An experiment by Rand Conger and Peter Killeen (1974) illustrated
how the verbal community works. Four people sat around a table,
having a conversation about a topic of interest. Three of the people
were confederates of the experimenters, unbeknownst to the fourth
person, who was the subject and was told only that the experiment
was about social interactions and would be videotaped. Occasionally,
on variable-interval schedules, two small lights behind the subject
lit up to cue the persons to the subject's left and right to say some­
thing approving like "Good point" or "That's right" at the next
appropriate opportunity. The person sitting opposite the subject served
to facilitate the conversation. As the schedules on the left and right
varied, the frequency of these reinforcers from the left and right
varied. The subjects' verbal behavior shifted as the reinforcement
shifted. If the person on the right delivered more reinforcers, the sub­
ject spent more time talking to that person, and if the person on the
left delivered more reinforcers, the subject spent more time talking to
that person.

Speaker and Listener
Skinner (1957) defined verbal behavior as operant behavior that
requires the presence of another person for its reinforcement. This
other person, who reinforces the speaker's verbal behavior, is the
listener. Operant behavior such as opening the refrigerator or driving a
car cannot be called verbal behavior, because no listener need be present
for it to be reinforced.

The verbal episode
Figure 7.1 diagrams the events that go into a complete verbal episode.
In the example of Zack asking Stacy for the salt, the initiating context
or discriminative stimulus (S� ) for Zack's request is the situation that
he and Stacy are at the table, the potatoes lack salt, and the salt is out
of reach over by Stacy. Zack engages in the verbal behavior of moving
his larynx, tongue, lips, and so forth (By; the verbal action is written
in figure 7.1 with brackets around it). This verbal action generates
an auditory discriminative stimulus (SL written in figure 7.1 with
quotation marks around it). In the presence of " Please pass the salt,"
it becomes likely that Stacy will pass the salt. Zack's receiving the
salt reinforces the verbal activity of asking for it and also serves as a
discriminative stimulus, S�, for Zack to reciprocate in some way. He
says (moves larynx, tongue, lips, and so on), Thank you (in brackets),
which generates an auditory stimulus, "Thank you," which serves as a
reinforcer for Stacy's passing the salt.

Verbal Behavior and Language

A Scientific Model of Behavior

Like other operant behavior, verbal behavior requires only inter­
mittent reinforcement to be maintained. If Stacy were angry with Zack,
or busy with something, or hard of hearing, Zack might have to try
several times before he got the salt. He might even fail altogether on
this occasion, get up, and get the salt for himself. When the situation
repeats itself on another day, his requesting will occur again. After
several failures, the verbal behavior might extinguish, but probably
only with respect to Stacy. If Zack is at the table with Naomi, he will
ask for the salt. In other words, he would discriminate. Generally,
verbal behavior is highly persistent and reinforced only intermittently.
As with other operant behavior, verbal behavior requires less
reinforcement to be maintained than to be acquired. For a child's first
verbal actions, reinforcement is frequent and lavish. What is more
exciting to a parent than the child's first words? No matter if the child
says da-ee for daddy, lee for milk, pee bur for peanut butter praise and
affection are heaped on. The situation changes, of course, as the child
gets older. Parents accept da-ee, lee, and pee bur in a two-year-old, but
the same verbal actions in a four-year-old would be corrected and
possibly mildly punished. Like much other operant behavior, verbal
behavior is shaped over time by successive approximation.
Ernst Moerk (1983) studied tape recordings made by Roger Brown
(1973) of a mother interacting with her daughter, Eve, who was
between 18 and 27 months old. The mother-child "conversations" were
extremely lopsided, with the mother uttering four or five sentences
for every utterance of the child. Moerk estimated that Eve's mother
generated more than 20,000 model sentences every day. At about
18 months of age, Eve responded to her mother's talking by imitating
parts of it. Her mother would say something like " Now you can have
a cookie. Do you want a cookie?" Eve would respond cookie, which
her mother would reinforce with utterances like " That's right, you
want a cookie" and with giving her a cookie.
Human children appear to be so constructed as to be likely to imitate
speech sounds they hear from significant others. Between that genetic­
ally programmed predisposition and the reinforcers provided by these
significant others as listeners, verbal behavior is acquired and shaped.
-

The listener's role
For the child learning to speak and for the adult speaking fluently,
the listener plays a crucial role. Without listeners, or the verbal com­
munity, verbal behavior could not be acquired. As listeners, Snow's

Examples
The very notion of verbal behavior contradicts the conventional view
of speaking and listening. To say there is such a thing as verbal behavior
is to say that speaking and listening are not special and different from
other behavior, but are continuous with it. In other words, verbal
behavior is like other operant behavior.
In keeping with this continuity, examples abound of operant behavior
that might or might not be called verbal. The category "verbal behavior"

1 36

A Scientific Model of Behavior

is a fuzzy category, one that is poorly defined around the edges. The
fuzziness presents no problem because it underscores the similarity
between verbal behavior and other operant behavior. Even if some of
our behavior is clearly nonverbal and some may or may not be verbal,
the concept of verbal behavior includes a lot of what we do. To under­
stand the scope of the concept, we turn now to some examples that are
either clearly verbal or nonverbal or are ambiguous.

The importance of history
Suppose a stranger begins speaking to you in Russian, and you don't
understand a word. This behavior cannot possibly be reinforced. Is
this verbal behavior? Are you a listener?
Even though the stranger's speaking cannot be reinforced in this
situation, it can be called verbal behavior, because it was reinforced in
past situations by the stranger's verbal comrminity. That it cannot be
reinforced on this occasion in no way disqualifies it, because verbal
behavior often goes unreinforced on particular occasions. This sort of
behavior qualifies as verbal because it arises from a history of rein­
forcement by a community of speakers and listeners.
The answer to the question of whether you are a listener even though
you cannot understand a word of Russian depends not only on the
stranger's history of reinforcement, but also on perspective. From your
perspective, you cannot be a listener, because you cannot reinforce the
stranger's behavior. From his perspective, however, you are being
treated as a member of the stimulus category " listener." He will soon
discover his mistake and discriminate - that is, he will go elsewhere
or speak to you in another language. His speaking to you in Russian
can be thought of as an instance of generalization. As a discriminative
stimulus, you look enough like a Russian listener for his behavior
to occur. Your inability to reinforce the behavior insures that it will
extinguish in your presence, but the initial action arose from a history
of reinforcement in the presence of listeners a lot like you. From the
perspective of that history, you are initially a listener, or at least a
potential listener.

Sign language and gestures
Suppose you and the stranger share no common language, and he
resorts to gestures. He points to his wrist and looks at you question­
ingly. You show him your wristwatch, and he nods and smiles. Do his
gestures count as verbal behavior?

is defined in terms of speech so as to exclude gestures, then of course
it belongs only to humans. The definition of verbal behavior could be
similarly narrowed so as to exclude nonhuman animals. Such defini­
tions, however, would deny language and verbal behavior to signers.
The present definition, by requiring that speaker and listener be able
to exchange roles, rules out trivial cases like my cat and me, but,
because it includes gestures, allows the possibility of verbal behavior
in nonhumans.
The human species is unique - every species is unique - not because
of any one particular characteristic, but because of a unique combina­
tion. By definition, no other species can share the whole constellation
of characteristics that make us human, but any one of the characteristics
might be shared with another species. From the perspective of evolution­
ary theory, humans are one species among many (and not necessarily
superior to any other species) and are not divided by some insuperable
barrier from "the animals." The thrust of behavior analysis is away
from distinctions based on species membership and toward distinctions
based on relations between behavior and environment, such as operant
versus induced behavior (chapter 4) and speaker versus listener.

Talking to myself
When I talk to myself, is that verbal behavior? Behavior analysts dis­
agree about this. Their answers depend on whether they accept the
idea that the speaker and listener in a verbal episode can be the same
person.
From figure 7.1, we see that if the same person can be listener and
speaker, then the verbal behavior of the speaker, Bv, is reinforced by a
change in behavior, BL, on the part of the same person (viewed as
listener). This might happen, for example, when I instruct or com­
mand myself. In driving to an unfamiliar house, I might say to myself
at an intersection, Now, here I should turn left. If I as a listener then turn
left, that reinforces the verbal act (the self-instruction to turn left),
particularly if I successfully reach my destination.
My self-instruction could be said aloud, or it could be said privately
or covertly. In the laboratory, with the right instruments subvocal
speech can be detected, but in everyday situations I can say things
to myself without detectably involving the speech apparatus. Such
covert verbal behavior corresponds to one use of the word thinking, as
when someone sitting still is said to be thinking to himself or herself.
Whether covert or overt, my talking to myself would have to
result in a change in my behavior (as listener) before it could be called

Verbal Behavior and Language

139

verbal behavior. Self-instructions and self-commands (Hold your tongue!)
qualify. Even a self-declaration, such as That is a beautiful painting,
would qualify, if I then took some action, like looking up the artist's
name or asking the price.
What about singing or reciting a poem to myself, as we say, just for
enjoyment's sake? Would this qualify as verbal behavior? According
to our definition, it doesn't because no one is playing the role of
listener. Reciting a poem may be reinforced by the sound produced,
but the reinforcer requires no listener-behavior on the reciter's part.
We know that not all verbal behavior is vocal (e.g., sign language).
NoW we know that not all vocal behavior is verbal.
Behavior analysts who reject the idea that talking to oneself consti­
tutes verbal behavior regard it as part of an extended unit of action an activity. Such extended or molar units play a large role in Rachlin's
approach to operant behavior, discussed in chapter 3. In this view, my
driving to the unfamiliar house would constitute a unitary activity,
defined by its function. The activity might occur in a variety of ways,
following different routes, with or without self-instructions, but all the
variants would be considered occurrences of the same (functional)
activity. Each drive would be an episode of the same activity, as we saw
in chapter 4 (figure 4.3). If driving with self-instructions gets me to my
destination (i.e., is reinforced) more often, then I will do that more often.
Most likely, I will drive that way the first few times I drive to that par­
ticular place, and as the route becomes familiar, driving without self­
instruction will take over. Thus, talking to myself is like my reciting a
poem to myself; the reinforcement results from sources other than a
listener. When behavior is thought of in these molar terms, an activity
cannot qualify as verbal unless the listener differs from the speaker.

Verbal Behavior versus Language
Verbal behavior differs from language. The word language, when used
in phrases like "the English language" or " American sign language,"
seems to be a thing. Language is often spoken of as a possession,
something that is acquired and then used. The common idea that lan­
guage is used like a tool raises all the problems of mentalism. Where is
this tool? What is it made of? Who uses it, and how, and where? How
does this tool cause speech? And so on.
Verbal behavior comprises concrete natural events, whereas lan­
guage is an abstraction. The English language, as a set of words and
grammatical rules for combining them, is a rough description of verbal
behavior. It summarizes the way a lot of people talk. It is rough,

not be called verbal behavior. Finally, some activities are categorized
in only one of the circles. An alarm call that is a fixed action pattern
would be vocal, but neither verbal nor "using language." Gestures
like waving and pointing are verbal behavior only. Writing a book in
the privacy of one's study, an instance of "using language," is not
vocal, and because no listener need be present for its reinforcement,
neither is it verbal behavior.

Figure 7.2: The relationships among the categories verbal behavior,

because people often speak poor English. Neither the explanations in
a dictionary nor the rules in a book of grammar exactly coincide with
the utterances of English speakers.
Although talk of " using language" is mentalistic and misleading,
when we say a person is doing this, that person is usually engaging
in verbal behavior. Instances of "using language" that might not
be considered verbal behavior, as we saw earlier, could be activities
like writing a book or reciting a poem to oneself. Conversely, some
instances of verbal behavior, such as waving and pointing, might not
be considered "using language."
Figure 7.2 illustrates the relationships among verbal behavior, vocal
behavior, and " using language." Each circle represents one of the three
categories, and particular activities can be thought of as points inside
the circles. Since the circles overlap, particular activities can lie in
more than one circle, meaning they belong to more than one category.
The shaded central subset (labeled "speaking") indicates those events
that belong to all three categories: people speaking to other people.
The areas where two circles overlap indicate activities that belong
to those two categories but not to the third: A person or nonhuman
animal might emit cries or other sounds (vocal behavior) that could be
considered verbal behavior, but would not be considered "using lan­
guage." Signing would be verbal behavior and could be called "using
language," but cannot be called vocal. Reciting a poem aloud to one­
self would be vocal behavior and " using language," but probably would

Like other operant behavior, verbal behavior consists of actions that
belong to operant activities that are (1) defined functionally and (2)
subject to stimulus control. These two ideas set the concept of verbal
behavior apart from traditional views about language and speech.

Verbal Activities As Functional Units
In chapter 5, we distinguished structural units from functional units.
Every event can be said to have a certain structure, and probably each
particular event has a unique structure. A rat probably cannot press
a lever twice exactly the same way, using exactly the same muscles
to exactly the same extent. (Even if a rat could produce two struc­
turally identical presses, they would still be unique events, because
they occurred at different times.) In contrast, functional units are not
particular events, but species or populations of particular events (recall
figure 4.3), defined by their effects in the environment.
Just like the rat's lever-press, each verbal action has a certain struc­
ture, a certain sequence of motions of various muscles in the throat
and mouth. When a novelist represents an utterance in writing, the
novelist is making only a crude description of what an actual utter­
ance is like; the reader has to imagine the timing and intonation.
Phonetic systems of notation represent verbal actions more accurately.
For example, the phonetic spelling of a word in a dictionary gives us
some idea of how to pronounce the word. However, no representation
can truly capture the particular utterance, because each particular utter­
anCe is unique. Even if you try, saying the same thing twice in exactly
the same way is virtually impossible. Something will change - your
inflection, your tone, your timing. Since we rarely even try to repeat
an utterance exactly, naturally occurring verbal behavior varies a lot.
A verbal activity is a species of actions, all of which have the
same effect on the listener. Just as all the structurally different ways of

A Scientific Model of Behavior

Verbal Behavior and Language

pressing a lever belong to the same activity because they all have the
effect of getting the lever pressed, so all the structurally different ways
that Zack requests the salt belong to the same activity because they all
have the same effect on the listener - getting the salt passed. Zack may
ask for the salt in many different ways: May I please have the salt ?,
Please pass the salt, I would appreciate it if you would pass the salt, and so
on. To a linguist, these might seem fundamentally different utterances:
the first is a question, the second an imperative sentence, the third a
declarative sentence. Varied though they may be structurally, they all
belong to the same verbal activity because they all have the same
effect on Stacy (she passes the salt). Some members of the activity may
even lie outside of "using language"; it may suffice for Zack to catch
Stacy's eye and point at the salt. If we were to list all the structurally
different ways that Zack requests the salt and other things, the list
would be long and varied, yet all variants would be episodes of the
same verbal activity because they would all function equivalently.
Linguists describing the structure of possible sentences point to units
like words and morphemes (e.g., final -s on a plural noun and final -ed
on a past tense verb). For example, the sentence The cats moved is
analyzed into three words and five morphemes (the, cat, -s, move, and
-ed). Sentences can be broken down like this to analyze their struc­
ture, but such an analysis says nothing about the sentence's function.
Structurally, There is a tiger behind you and There is a child behind you
differ by just one word. They have the same pattern or frame (There
is X behind you), but the two utterances belong to different activities
because they have different effects. Many verbal activities include an
utterance structured like this, but that structure is just one among
many different structures. Think of all the other ways I might warn
you about danger.
Thus, just as a rat's lever-press structurally consists of many small
muscle movements, each necessary to the whole, so a verbal action
structurally consists of words and morphemes, each necessary to the
functioning of the whole. Although necessary, the structure tells noth­
ing about function. Function can be understood only from circum­
stances and effects.

depending on the circumstances. Think of all the different situations
in which the utterance water might occur: I am desperately thirsty.
"What is that puddle on the floor?" "What do you get when you
combine hydrogen with oxygen?" Do you know what we should add
now?" Since in each context the utterance water would have a different
effect on the listener, in each context water would belong to a different
verbal activity.
The relation of circumstances to the likelihood of the verbal activity is
the relation of stimulus control (chapter 6), not elicitation (chapter 4).
No strict one-to-one correspondence exists between a discriminative
stimulus and a verbal activity, the way taps on the knee might be
related to jerks of the leg. The discriminative stimuli only modulate
and make it likely that certain verbal activities will occur.
Among the most important discriminative stimuli modulating
verbal behavior are auditory and visual stimuli generated by another
person acting as speaker. Having played listener for the other person,
I may play the role of speaker and generate discriminative stimuli that
affect the other person's behavior.
As we noted in chapter 6, all operant activities occur within a con­
text, and the enabling effect that the context has on the activity arises
from the history of reinforcement associated with that context in the
past. As with other operant activities, so with verbal activities. When I
am lost, I ask directions because I was taught to do so, and such verbal
behavior was reinforced in the past by my reaching my destination.
Context can make a difference to the exact structure of my requests.
In asking directions of a stranger, I am more polite than in asking
directions of my brother. Asking directions in rural New Hampshire, I
will be careful how I phrase my question. If I say, "Does this road go
to Newmarket?" I am apt to get a reply "That road don't go nowhere;
it just sits there." I have to say, "Please tell me the way to Newmarket."
Then I will either get directions or, after some thought, "No, you can't
get there from here."
Like other operant activities, verbal activities cannot be defined
solely in terms of their consequences. The context usually needs to
be specified also. Requesting directions from a stranger differs from
requesting directions from a familiar person. Are these two different
activities, differing because of the contexts in which they occur? If you
Were studying politeness theory, which concerns the way that verbal
behavior depends on the person addressed, you might want to make
the distinction. For other purposes, "requesting directions" or even
"making requests" might be fine enough. Warning someone about a
tiger differs from warning someone about a mosquito, but for many
p urposes "warning someone of danger" might do as a verbal activity.

1 42

Stimulus Control of Verbal Behavior
As with other operant activities, a verbal activity becomes more or less
likely to occur, depending on circumstances - that is, depending on
discriminative stimuli. One reason that a word cannot constitute a
functional unit is that the same word can serve different functions,

143

of motions result in the lever being pressed; those would be the per­
missible "sentences." As before, the characteristic that is supposed
to set verbal behavior apart can be seen as shared by other behavior.
(We will return a little later to a separate discussion of the notion that
speakers follow the rules of grammar while speaking.)

Common Misunderstandings ·
The idea of verbal behavior emphasizes the similarity of speaking
and gesturing to other types of operant behavior. Conventional views
try to set language-related behavior apart, to define it as special
and different. Three characteristics that have been urged as unique to
language-related behavior are (1) that it is generative that people
constantly generate novel utterances; (2) that speaking, unlike other
behavior, can refer to itself; and (3) that speaking, unlike other behavior,
can refer to events in the future. Let us see if these really set language­
related behavior apart from other behavior.
-

The generative nature of language
Every day you generate utterances you have never made before.
Probably most sentences you speak are novel in this sense. In fact,
each utterance is unique, because you cannot make two exactly the
same. When we discussed novelty in chapter 5, we saw that this non­
repeatability characterizes all operant behavior. It is not that verbal
behavior is varied and other behavior is fixed, as the conventional
view would hold, but that all operant behavior is just as varied as
verbal behavior. Each lever-press is unique, just as each request for
salt is unique. Requesting salt is just as much a functional unit as is
pressing a lever.
Critics of this view point to the importance of grammar in generat­
ing utterances. Grammar is a part of any language, and grammatical
structure is often a feature of verbal behavior. However, the best we
can say about the rules of grammar is that they offer a rough descrip­
tion of the structure of some verbal behavior. Real speech is frequently
(and sometimes mostly) ungrammatical. Our complete " sentences"
often break the rules of sentence construction, and we often leave
sentences unfinished.
Still, spoken English generally follows the order subject-verb­
object, and is regular in other ways, too. However, the rough struc­
tural regularities that characterize verbal behavior also characterize
other behavior. A regular sequence of motions goes into each of a rat's
lever-presses. Each lever-press could be equated with a sentence, and
we could write a grammar of lever-presses. Only certain sequences

145

Talking about talking
Linguists and logicians make much of statements called meta-statements,
which refer to themselves or other statements. Meta-statements form
the basis of some arguments that the ability of language to refer to
itself sets it apart from other behavior. When I was a boy, my friends
and I enjoyed the paradox "This statement is false." From a logical
point of view, this meta-statement has a sort of magical quality
because it seems to be true and false at the same time. Viewed as
talking - as verbal behavior - however, it has nothing magical about
it. It conforms to the standard English sentence frame, subject-verb­
attribute. The only unusual aspect of this particular utterance is that
the subject is an utterance.
To the behavior analyst, meta-statements are talk about talking that is, verbal behavior under stimulus control of other verbal behavior.
Talk about talking occurs all the time. If you didn't hear what I said,
you ask me what I just said, and I repeat it. Your question plus what I
said, which I heard perfectly well, constitute the discriminative stimulus
for my repeat verbal action. My ability to do this derives from a 10ng
history of reinforcement for this sort of repetition; we are trained from
an early age to repeat verbal actions for effect and on cue.
Repeating an utterance on request is an example of verbal self­
reporting, which is verbal behavior partly under the control of one's
own behavior as discriminative stimulus or context. In chapter 3, we
noticed that if someone reports on his or her own behavior, we are
inclined to say the person is "conscious" of it. In chapter 6, we noticed
that one's own behavior may relate to verbal reporting in the same
way as a light relates to a rat's lever-pressing - as a discriminative
stimulus or context relates to an operant activity. You can ask me
what I did this morning, and I can report, I went to the store. You can
ask me what I said at a meeting yesterday, and I can report, I said " We
need to plan a budget for the coming year. " Either way, my present verbal
behavior is under the control of a context provided by my own previ­
ous behavior, verbal or nonverbal.
We can report also on private verbal behavior, as when you ask me
what I am thinking, and I say I was thinking how nice it would be to go

to the beach today. My verbal behavior then is partly under control of a
private discriminative stimulus.
Sometimes we.talk about talk that never actually occurred, but only
might have occurred. I might say, I felt like telling him to do it himself
This is a report, not on actual verbal behavior, but an inclination
toward certain verbal behavior. It resembles reporting on a purpose or
any other behavioral tendency (chapter 5). It is equivalent to saying,
"In the past, in circumstances like those, I often behaved so."
We talk also about talk that never occurred but might occur now. I
might say, Let me tell you what I heard today. In part this is a request for
you to serve as listener, and in part this is a report on my inclination
to engage in the verbal behavior of reporting on something I heard. As
with other reports of inclination or purpose (chapter 5), although it
might sound like a reference to the future, it really arises from a his­
tory of reinforcement for such verbal behavior in such circumstances
(having heard something the repeating of which will be reinforced by
the listener) in the past.

Meaning
In the conventional view of language-related behavior, words and
sentences have meaning, and the meaning contained in an utterance is
passed from speaker to listener. To a linguist interested in a formal
analysis of the structure of English (not natural spoken English, but
"correct" English), such a view might do little harm. As a theory of
the activity of speaking or verbal behavior, however, it suffers all the
shortcomings of any mentalistic theory.

Reference Theories

Talking about the fu ture
When you talk about verbal behavior you are inclined to engage in,
it sounds as though you are talking about the future. Since future
events cannot affect present behavior, people are tempted to invent a
cause in the present - an inner purpose or meaning - and even to
insist that talk about the future proves the existence of mental images.
Supposedly pigs in your mind cause you to say, I am going to tell you
about pigs. As we saw in chapter 5, such imaginary inner causes only
distract us from the environmental events that led up to the verbal
action, your past experiences with pigs and listeners who reinforced
verbal behavior under the control of such past experiences.
Nothing need be going on in my mind or anywhere inside for me
to talk in ways that seem to refer to events in the future or, for that
matter, any other events that have never occurred. I have never seen a
purple cow, but I have pronounced purple and cow and put adjectives
together with nouns. My utterance including the phrase purple cow in
no way requires that I have a purple cow in my mind or anywhere
else. It only requires that I have a history of reinforcement for the sort
of verbal behavior that people often call imaginative.
Similarly, if I talk to you on Monday about an appointment we will
have on Friday, I need have no ghostly image or meaning in mind.
Making and keeping appointments is operant behavior arising from a
long history of reinforcement. You tell me you want to see me. Hearing

147

Philosophers and psychologists, trying to turn the rough everyday
notion of meaning into a more definite theory of language, invented
theories that rely on the notion of reference. The word dog, for example,
whether spoken, written, or heard, is said to refer to the sort of four­
legged mammal that barks. Speakers and writers are said to use the
spoken or written word dog in place of the actual dog. Listeners and
readers are said to use the heard or seen word dog to understand
something about the actual dog. Such a view leaves completely un­
answered the question of why the speaker or writer spoke or wrote
the word in the first place, and what the listener or reader does as a
result of hearing or seeing the word. Does it add any useful idea to the
observation that one person speaks and the other does something as
a result?

Symbols and lexicons
The notion of reference suggests that the different forms of the word
dog spoken, heard, written, seen - are symbols for the category of
actual dogs. How can all these symbols be recognized as equivalent?
The mentalistic response is that all the different symbols are somehow
connected to something inside. Since actual dogs cannot be inside

supposed to exist somewhere inside, and all the symbols for dog are
said to be linked to this representation.
Where is this representation? It is said to be in a lexicon, a collection
of such representations of objects and events of the real world. The
speaker is said to look for the representation in the lexicon, find it there
connected to its symbols, and then to use the appropriate symbol. The
listener is said to hear the symbol, look up the symbol in the lexicon,
find it connected with its representation, and then understand it.
The mentalism of this theory is apparent. Where is this lexicon?
What is it made of? What is its origin? Who does all this looking up
and using? Do these complicated mental events really shed any light
on speaking, hearing, writing, and reading?
The idea of reference was probably invented to explain equival­
ences. How is it possible for me, on seeing or thinking of a dog, to act
in a variety of ways, speak, sign, or write, "dog," all with equivalent
effects on the listener? How is it possible for me to hear, "dog," see the
written word, or the sign, and treat these different stimuli equival­
ently? Add to this variety the words for dog in different languages,
and you may see how tempting it is to suppose that all these actions
and stimuli are equivalent because they are all somehow tied to some
representation or meaning somewhere inside.
It is altogether too easy to suppose that the observed equivalence
arises from some ghostly inner equivalence. But where did the
observed (or ghostly) equivalence come from? That question needs to
be answered before we can say we understand the equivalence. No
one comes into the world behaving the same way on hearing the
sound "dog" and on seeing a dog, or on hearing "dog" and hearing
the French chien. We come to do this over time, as a result of expos­
ure to these different stimuli and a history of reinforcement for the
appropriate response. Behavior analysts have begun studying the ways
in which stimulus equivalence is learned in animals and children.
Creatures can be trained to behave differently with two different stimuli
and to behave the same. What are the conditions necessary for the
learning of the equivalence? The temptation to posit some ghostly
inner equivalence to explain the observed equivalence will disappear
when the observed equivalence can be understood as the result of a
history of reinforcement in context.

Meaning As Use
As with other mentalistic terms, like consciousness, purpose, and know­
ledge, the term meaning, strictly speaking, has no place in behavior
analysis. The question " How does one know the meaning of a word?"
is a pseudo-problem. It asks after the meaning as one would ask after
the spelling, as if meaning were an attribute of the word. Instead of
talking about meaning, behaviorists talk about the use or function
of an action or utterance. Roughly speaking, that is the "meaning" of
meaning.

150

A Scientific Model of Behavior

Conseq uences and context
Suppose I put a rat in a chamber with a lever and
a chain. Pulling
on the chain produces food; pressing on the lever produ
ces water. The
rat pulls and eats, presses and drinks. You could
say that the "mean­
ing" of chain-pulling is "food," and the "meaning"
of lever-pressing is
"water." A person in the same situation might make
the sound food
and receive food, make the sound water and receiv
e water. Are these
situations fundamentally different? The behaviorist
says no. The rat
has had no food for a time - it pulls the chain
and gets food. Aaron
has had no food for a time - he says food and gets
food. The rat has
had no water for a time - it presses the lever and
gets water. Aaron
has had no water for a time - he says water and gets
water. Either way,
the use of the action consists of its consequen
ces (getting food or
water) in the context (having had no food or wate
r for a time, being in
the chamber, being with a listener).
The " meaning" of verbal behavior is its use, its conse
quences in the
context. Why do we bother to learn the names
of people we meet? So
that we can get them to play listener (consequence)
when we are near
them (context) or so that we can converse abou
t them with other
listeners (consequence) when they are absent (cont
ext). The "mean­
ing" of a name is the context and consequences
of its occurrence.
This idea of meaning as use underlies much of
our previous dis­
cussion of difficult everyday terms: consciousn
ess, purpose, knowledge,
and so on. For each term, we asked after the
conditions (context)
in which it is likely to occur. The context in
which someone would
make an utterance including the word meaning
tells us the " meaning"
of meaning. To ask after the meaning of any
term is to ask after the
context and consequences of its occurrence.
As with other operant behavior, verbal behavior
depends on a his­
tory of reinforcement. To say that the use
or meaning of a verbal '
activity is its consequences in the context is to
say that its occurrence
depends on a history of such consequences
in such contexts in the
past. When making requests, my children
learned to include please
because again and again reinforcers were avail
able only for requests
including that word.

Varieties of use
Verbal actions, in everyday terms, serve a variety of purposes. Two of
the most important are to request and to inform. The verbal episode
diagrammed in figure 7.1 exemplifies a request, and it belongs to a

Verbal Behavior and Language

151

larger category in which the utterance specifies its own reinforcer.
Skinner (1957) named such an utterance a mand. Mands include not
only requests, but commands, questions, and even advice. The army
sergeant who says Left face! makes a mand, the reinforcer of which is
left-facing. My asking you What time is it? is a mand, the reinforcer of
which is hearing or seeing the correct time. A parent advising a child
You should take algebra this year is making a mand, the reinforcer of
which is the child's taking algebra. The exact setting in which the
request, question, or advice may occur can vary widely, and yet we
still recognize it as the same mand - whether Zack is asking Stacy for
the salt or whether he asks Shona, Aaron, or Naomi - because the
reinforcer is the same. When the reinforcer of an utterance is well
specified, the utterance is a mand.
In contrast, utterances that might be considered informative specify
no particular reinforcer but rather occur in the presence of some
particular discriminative stimulus. The whole point of the utterance
There is a tiger behind you is the tiger; the reinforcer that the listener will
provide (profuse thanks perhaps) remains unspecified. Skinner (1957)
called such utterances tacts.
The warning about the tiger might have some of the quality of a
mand, if we grant that the listener's avoiding the tiger might be the
likely reinforcer for the speaker's utterance. The distinction is not
absolute, because the reinforcers for tacts, although unspecified, are
usually conventionally social: responses like gratitude and attention.
A more pure example of a tact might be one person saying to another,
What a beautiful day. Exactly how the listener may reinforce this action
remains to be seen; the main factors for understanding its occurrence
are the setting (sun, blue sky, listener) and the history of reinforce­
ment for such utterances in such settings.
Tacts include a wide variety of utterances. Opinions and observa­
tions are tacts. Replies to questions are often tacts: You look at your
watch and tell me the correct time. What we have been calling verbal
reports are all examples of tacts: My son is wearing a blue shirt, I have
a pain in my shoulder, You can get a ticket at window number two. The
first of these is a straightforward verbal report occasioned particularly
by the blue shirt. The second is unusual in one way; it may be partly
under control of a private discriminative stimulus, an injury to the
shoulder. The discriminative stimulus for the third is more involved,
because it depends on a history of events: my having gone to window
number two and gotten a ticket. It is occasioned by a reinforcement
relation: Going to window number two is reinforced by getting a ticket.
Seen this way, the third tact is an example of a rule, an important
concept that we will take up in chapter 8.

Dictionary definitions

Grammar and Syntax

If words and utterances cannot be understood by their inherent " mean­
ing," then why should we bother with dictionary definitions? Let us
rephrase the question. How are dictionary definitions helpful? When I
come across an unfamiliar word and consult a dictionary, I do not learn
the meaning of the word; I get a summary of how the word is used,
usually with one or more examples and some synonyms (different
words that might Occur in similar circumstances or have similar
effects) and antonyms (words that occur in contrasting circumstances
or have contrasting effects). All of this helps to guide my behavior as
reader, listener, speaker, and writer.
Dictionaries do not contain meanings. They exemplify the general
way that we learn how to use words, by hearing and seeing them
used. How did you learn jump, run, talk, car, and baby? Most of the
words we use we never look up in a dictionary, and no one ever
defines them for us. If this were not so, dictionaries would be useless,
because they explain how to use a word in terms of other words
that are supposed to be familiar already. When I was thirteen and
wondered about the word fornication, the dictionary related it to terms
that (I thought) I understood.

Technical terms
What is true of everyday words you might look up in a dictionary
is doubly true of technical terms invented by scientists and other pro­
fessionals. A term is always defined in terms of others. Sometimes
several interrelated terms are all equally familiar (or unfamiliar) yet
are still all defined in terms of one another. Consider the terms trait,
gene, and inherit. None can be defined without using the other two.
So, too, with the terms of behavior analysis: reinforcement, operant, dis­
criminative stimulus. What is operant behavior? Behavior that is more
likely in the presence of a discriminative stimulus because of a history
of reinforcement in the presence of that stimulus.
This interdependence of definitions only seems to be a problem if
we insist that each term must have its own separate meaning, suitable
for storage in a ghostly lexicon. It poses no real problem for scientists;
it is simply a feature of scientific vocabularies. Interdependence of
terms just means that they tend to be used together.

1 53

Linguists and cognitive psychologists interested in language have
tended to focus on grammar, the rules by which words are put
together into sentences. We have been calling this order (syntax) the
structure of verbal behavior. Although there need not have been a
conflict between the behavior analysts' interest in function and the
linguists' interest in structure, Noam Chomsky (1959), an influential
linguist, wrote a bitter review of Skinner's book Verbal Behavior that
discouraged many from exploring the behavior-analytic approach.
About 30 years had to pass before some linguists began to take an
interest in the functional approach (e.g., Andresen, 1991). Yet the ques­
tion remains: How do behavior analysts deal with syntax?

Rules As Descriptions
Every language has its regularities. In English, the usual order for a
sentence is subject-verb-object. In the sentence "Shona kissed Nick,"
the regular word order clarifies just who kissed whom. Many variants
occur in the place of subject and object. In "The book on the table
caught Naomi's eye," a noun phrase of the form noun-preposition­
article-noun serves as subject, and a noun phrase of the form adjective­
noun serves as object. The overall structure of the sentence can be seen
as a higher-order regularity, the structures of phrases as lower-order
regularities. Regularities like appending 's for possession, -s for plural­
ity, and -ed for past tense would be lower order still.
The job of the grammarian is to invent rules that generate all the
sentences that are considered correct by speakers of the language. A
grammar, a set of rules, like this would offer a concise description of
much spoken English. Grammarians debate over the best approach
to grammar. There is no one English grammar; several candidates vie
with one another, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.
Chomsky invented a particularly general approach known as trans­
formational grammar that can apply to almost any language. It begins
with a basic pattern like subject-verb-object and then lists all the rules
by which this pattern can be transformed into acceptable sentences.
For example, the passive transformation would be to interchange
subject and object and insert the correct form of to be and the word by
so "Shona kissed Nick" becomes " Nick was kissed by Shona."
Working out possible English grammars offers an interesting intel­
lectual challenge, and creating a grammar could be useful in teaching
-

1 55

A Scientific Model of Behavior

Verbal Behavior and Language

English to middle-school students and adults. However interesting or
useful, though, a grammar of English remains just a description of the
regularities of English.
Having listed an apparently complete set of rules for English,
Chomsky imagined that these rules are innate - built in somewhere
inside the person. This, of course, is mentalism: having observed regu­
larities in behavior, the mentalist imagines rules somewhere inside the
organism. Where the regularities come from remains unanswered.
Skinner's idea of verbal behavior allowed the possibility that English
syntax might be partly or wholly learned.

that it moves to the
inside? Similarly, shou ld we say that a four­

1 54

Competence and performance
Since grammarians treat only correct English, when they turn to
English as actually spoken they perceive an uncomfortable mismatch
between the ideal and the actual. Their only response to "errors" in
actual discourse is to correct them. They have no way to account for
them, because a grammar is in no sense a theory of behavior. Gram­
matical rules are norms, showing how speakers generally behave and
how, in society's eyes, they ought to behave.
Grammarians like Chomsky misperceive the nature of grammar
because they fall into the mentalistic trap of supposing that the rules
must exist in some form somewhere inside speakers and listeners. The
mistake involved resembles the mistake one could make with a term
like "team spirit," discussed in chapter 3, and arises from the way
people speak. They say the team shows team spirit, and that we follow
the rules of grammar. Both are misleading; the first makes team spirit
seem as if it were something separate from the behavior of the team,
and the second makes the rules of grammar seem as if they were
something separate from the person's speaking and writing.
Supposing the rules to be separate from the behavior, mentalists
like Chomsky distinguish between competence (the ideal, the rules) and
performance (the actual speaking and writing). Competence is the ghostly
inner ideal. It is what people supposedly " know," but don't always
do. The difference between competence and performance is "error."
The notion of competence presents the same problems as other men­
talistic explanations, and if we apply it to other examples, its useless­
ness becomes clear. If we say the planets follow elliptical orbits around
the sun, do we mean that each planet has inside it a competence, an
ideal elliptical orbit? If a planet's orbit deviates a bit from an exact
ellipse, will we call that " error"? Skinner's example: When a dog catches
a ball thrown high into the air, the dog can be said in a sense to

Grammar and grammarians
Another way of thinking about competences in general and grammar
in particular is to recognize that they are idealized descriptions of actual
performance. An idealization is always a simplification and, hence,
inaccurate. The error is not in the performance, but in the simplified
description. The performance is accurate; the rules may be inaccurate.
Grammarians make up sets of rules, or grammars. As long as this
is an interesting and useful thing to do, the grammarians' behavior
. will continue to be reinforced. No matter how precise, however, a
grammar tells us nothing about how and why people come to say the
things they do. Once we recognize that speaking and writing are forms
of operant behavior, we begin to explain them.

Where Are the Rules?
If the rules of grammar are not inside the speaker, then where are
they? One could argue that there need be no rules anywhere, but our
discussion of the behavior of scientists in chapter 6 leads to a different
idea. Instead, we can say that the rules are in the verbal behavior of
the observer the scientist or grammarian. The grammarian, like the
scientist, having made observations, summarizes them in a concise
form. In other words, the grammarian verbalizes a set of rules. If we
listen to those rules and follow them when they are spoken by an
English teacher, that is because we are trained to listen and obey. We
will go into these matters more deeply in the next chapter.
_

Summary
Verbal behavior is operant behavior that requires the presence of a
listener for its reinforcement. The speaker and listener must belong to
the same verbal community - they must be able to switch roles. Verbal
behavior exemplifies the everyday term communication, a situation in
which the behavior of one organism creates stimuli that change the

157

A Scientific Model of Behavior

Verbal Behavior and Language

behavior of another. Like other operant behavior, verbal behavior is
explained by its consequences and context. It has consequences as a
result of the actions of the listener, who is a major part of the context.
Zack asks Stacy for the salt because listeners like Stacy reinforced
verbal actions of this sort in Zack's history of reinforcement. Verbal
behavior appears to begin in imitation and then is shaped by con­
sequences such as receiving cookies and parental attention. Apart from
the roles of the listener and verbal community, verbal behavior is just
like other operant behavior. According to the definition, gestures and
sign language, even though nonvocal, would count as verbal behavior,
and non-operant behavior, even though vocal, would not count.
Although specific examples might be ambiguous, these are of little
importance because behaviorists aim to bring out the similarity of
"using language" to other operant behavior, not to set it apart. In
contrast to verbal behavior, language is an abstraction. The idea that
language is used like a tool is an example of mentalism.
Verbal activities, like other operant activities, are functional units.
The same verbal activity contains many utterances, each one structur­
ally unique. All the utterances that belong to the same verbal activity
belong to it in part because they all have the same effect on the
listener. In this respect, all the structurally different ways that one
might ask for the salt or warn someone of a danger could be parts of
the same verbal activity - "asking for salt" or "warning of danger."
Like other operant activities, verbal activities are subject to stimulus
control; they become more likely in certain contexts. As with other
operant activities, the second part of the definition of a verbal activity,
besides its effects, is the context in which it occurs. Utterances that
are similar from a structural standpoint can belong to totally differ­
ent verbal activities, depending on context. Variation in context may
modulate the structural variants of the activity that are likely to occur.
Some thinkers have suggested that language use is different from
other types of behavior because it is generative, can refer to itself, and
can refer to the future. The generative nature of speech appears to lie
in the structural regularity and frequent novelty of utterances. Since
these properties are shared by all other operant behavior, they do not
set language use apart. That speaking can refer to itself also fails to set
it apart, because this only means that one verbal action can produce a
discriminative stimulus for another. Nonverbal operant behavior can
both provide and be controlled by discriminative stimuli in the same
way. The apparent ability of speech to refer to the future resembles
the ability of other discriminative stimuli to affect behavior after their
occurrence, after a gap of time. It has nothing special about it, and it
can be understood without resort to mentalism.

Like other operant behavior, verbal activities tend to occur in cer­
tain contexts; they are subject to stimulus control. If there is any mean­
ing to the "meaning" of a verbal action (e.g., an utterance or signing
gesture), it consists of the conditions under which the action is likely
to occur: the context and the reinforcement in that context. Under­
standing verbal actions in the light of their uses, we see that some are
directive (called mands) and depend more on the particular reinforce­
ment than on context, whereas some are informative (called tacts) and
depend more on the particular context than on reinforcement.
Grammar receives the attention of linguists and psychologists because
it describes regularities in structure. A grammar consists of a set of
rules that can generate all the sentences that are considered correct by
the speakers of the language. It describes the structure of that portion
of actual verbal behavior, but tells nothing about ungrammatical
verbal behavior or function. Some thinkers fall into the mentalistic
trap of imagining the rules of grammar to lie inside the person. The
rules lie, however, in the verbal behavior of those who state them.

Rule- Governed Behavior
and Thinking

Every culture has its rules. A child growing up in the culture may
learn to obey some of the rules without explicit instruction. I cannot
remember anyone ever telling me I had to wear clothes when I went
out in public. Although I cannot remember, someone may have, and
probably most rules are explicitly taught.
Learning rules from a speaker-teacher requires playing the role of
listener. Most children first learn to play listener - to discriminate on
the basis of speakers' verbal behavior - from their parents. Later this
effectiveness of verbal discriminative stimuli generalizes to others:
teachers, coaches, employers, and so on. Were it not for this docility,
we could never become acculturated (Simon, 1990). This chapter is
about the way behavior analysts understand the teaching and following
of rules.

What Is Rule- Governed Behavior?
To say that behavior is "governed" by a rule is to say that it is under
stimulus control by the rule and that the rule is a certain type of
discriminative stimulus - a verbal discriminative stimulus. When
my father told me, You must be home for supper by 6:00, that was a rule
that governed my behavior because the consequences of being late
were most uncomfortable. A rule can be written as well as spoken. A
"No smoking" sign in an elevator constitutes a verbal discriminative
stimulus, and the person who posted the sign constitutes a speaker
because the main reinforcer for posting the sign is the effect on those
Who read it ( listeners).

1 60

A Scientific Model of Behavior

Rule-Governed versus Implicitly Shaped Behavior
Only some behavior that can be described by rules can be called rule­
governed in the present sense. A pigeon trained to match to sample
(chapter 6) pecks at the key with the stimulus that matches the sample
key. It could be said to be following a rule, but the "rule" is only a
verbal summary, a brief description, of its performance. Whether a
nonhuman animal's behavior should ever be called rule-governed
remains a debatable point, but this pigeon's behavior cannot qualify
as rule-governed because no verbal discriminative stimulus is involved.
In chapter 7, I made a similar point about the rules of grammar;
insofar as a four-year-old's speech is grammatical, it "follows rules,"
but since the four-year-old cannot state the rules, and no one else
states them for the child, in the present sense its verbal behavior
cannot be called rule-governed.
Although people tend to say a person or animal is following a rule
whenever they notice some sort of regularity in behavior, here I use
the term to mean something more specific than just any complex
discrimination. We focus on discriminations that involve verbal state­
ments of rules, like the rules of a game, because historically, people's
ability to respond to the verbal behavior of others was considered
evidence in favor of mentalism. Behaviorists maintain that a scientific
account is possible, and try to show that rule-follOWing can be explained
by the concepts of behavior analysis (reinforcement and stimulus
control).
To help understand rule-governed behavior, I distinguish it from
implicitly shaped behavior (sometimes called "contingency-shaped"
behavior), which can be attributed solely to unspoken reinforcement
and punishment relations. All operant behavior - rule-governed
included - is shaped by reinforcement and punishment. The term
implicitly shaped in this context means behavior that is shaped directly
by relatively immediate consequences, not dependent on hearing or
reading a rule (as described in chapter 4). An incident in an episode
of the TV series All in the Family illustrates this: Archie Bunker argues
with his son-in-law, Mike, over the correct method of putting on socks
and shoes. Mike puts on a sock and a shoe on one foot and then the
other sock and shoe on the other foot. Archie puts on both socks and
then both shoes. Probably neither one was ever actually told to do it
the way he did it; the behavior of each was implicitly shaped.
Rule-governed behavior depends on the verbal behavior of another
person (a speaker), whereas implicitly shaped behavior requires no other
person, only interaction with nonsocial reinforcement. The difference

Rule-Govemed Behavior and Thinking

161

between Mike and Archie might have arisen by chance; each one's
way of putting on socks and shoes was reinforced by being able to do
the next activity in a sequence (chapter 4). Rule-governed behavior
is talked about, directed, instructed (under the control of verbal dis­
criminative stimuli), whereas implicitly shaped behavior arises without
instruction and frequently cannot be talked about. Ask someone how
he or she catches a ball, ask someone who has just told a joke how he
or she managed to tell it so well, or ask someone on a bicycle how he
or she succeeds in staying upright, and often the only answer you will
get is " I don't know, I just do it." He or she can demonstrate the
activity, but not talk about it, which is a sure sign that the behavior is
implicitly shaped.
Pure examples of implicitly shaped behavior are hard to think of,
because much of our behavior begins with instruction and shifts to
being shaped implicitly once it occurs in an approximation to the final
form. Beginning gymnasts are told first how to perform a stunt, to
carefully place hands and feet according to instructions, execute a crude
version, and then practice and practice. During practice, unspoken
relations between bodily movement and correct form shape the
behavior until the form is correct. Many of our skills conform to this
pattern: writing, driving, good manners, playing a musical instrument,
and so on. The first rough approximation is rule-governed, but the
final product is implicitly shaped.
In the terms of chapter 6, implicitly shaped behavior coincides with
procedural knowledge - knowing how. Once the behavior is shaped,
we know how to stay upright on a bicycle, even if we cannot explain
it. If the behavior and its consequences can be talked about, that is a
type of declarative knowledge - knowing about. Aaron knows about
the game of chess if he can explain its rules. Rule-giving nearly always
constitutes knowing about.
Of course, we often both know how to do something and know
about it, as well. We may learn to talk about implicitly shaped behavior
before or after it is shaped. The incident between Archie and Mike
illustrates also how readily we make and justify rules. Archie stops
Mike and tells him he should put on both socks before putting on a
shoe. Mike objects. Archie says, "What if there's a fire? If you run out
in the street, at least you won't be barefoot." Mike replies that at least
he would have one shoe on and could hop around on one foot. The
making of rules is part of our business as speakers. We discussed it
implicitly in chapter 7, and will return to it again in chapters 12
and 13, on values and culture. Right now we are concerned with the
jUstification of rules, because justification is verbal behavior about
reinforcement and punishment (At least you won't be barefoot).

Rule-Governed Behavior and Thinking

A Scientific Model of Behavior

Rules: Orders, Instructions, and Advice
Skinner (1953; 1969) defined a rule as a verbal discriminative stimulus
that points to a reinforcement relation. (Skinner used the word "con­
tingency," which often connotes contiguity between a response and a
reinforcer; instead, we will use the more general term "reinforcement
relation" to escape that connotation.) When people are playing a
game together, they often generate verbal discriminative stimuli with
utterances like If the ball touches the line, it's out or Four of a kind beats
a full house. These utterances are reinforced by the behavior of the
listeners (agreeing the ball is "out" and giving in to four of a kind).
What does it mean to say these rules "point to" relations?
When we are talking about operant behavior, as we are now, a
"reinforcement relation" means a relation between activity and con­
sequences. Planting seeds leads to crops - that is a reinforcement
relation. We saw in chapter 4 that every reinforcement relation can be .
summarized by a statement of the form " If this activity occurs, then
this consequence becomes more (or less) likely." If you plant seeds,
then crops become more likely. If you carry an umbrella, you are less
likely to get rained on.
To say that the verbal behavior of stating a rule "points to" the
relation is to say that giving the rule is under stimulus control by
the relation or that the relation sets the context for giving the rule.
In the terms of chapter 7, we could as well say the rule refers to the
relation. The statement If you turn left at the corner, you will come to the
bank reflects the speaker's experience - turning left at the corner made
coming to the bank more likely - a complex discriminative stimulus or
context. Similarly, if we are playing tennis and I tell you that the ball
is out if it crosses the line, my utterance is under the control of my
having hit balls that crossed the line and were called " out." The relation
pointed to is: If the ball is hit so as to cross the line (action), then the
punisher of losing the point becomes more likely. I would rarely state
the rule exactly this way, but this is a precise summary of my experience
and the context of my rule-giving.
An example of a laboratory experiment may help to clarify the
behaviorists' use of the term rule. Mark Galizio (1979) paid college
students to work in an experiment for up to seventy-five 50-minute
sessions. The apparatus they worked at is illustrated in figure 8.1. The
students were told that a maximum of two dollars could be earned in
a session, that occasionally a loss of five cents, signaled by the flash of
a red "loss" light and a tone, would occur, and that these losses could
be prevented by turning the rubber handle 45 degrees (which would

(rules) are shown in place.
flash the blue "feedback" light). In periods when losses were scheduled,
one would occur every ten seconds unless a handle-turn occurred.
Each experimental session was divided into four 12.5-minute periods,
with the following arrangements: in one period, each handle-turn post­
poned a loss by 10 seconds; in a second period, each handle-turn
postponed a loss by 30 seconds; in a third period, each handle-turn
postponed a loss by 60 seconds; and in a fourth period, no losses
were scheduled. In the 10-second postponement period, losses could.
be avoided if a handle-turn occurred at least once every 10 seconds;
in the 30- and 60-second postponement periods, handle-turns were
required at least every 30 and 60 seconds. The no-loss period required
no handle-turning. The four periods occurred in random order. Each
was signaled by one of the four amber lights shown in figure 8.l.
In the first phase of the experiment, no additional information was
given to the students, and only one out of four students displayed
appropriate rates of handle-turning during the four periods: highest in
the 10-second period, lower in the 30-second period, lower still in the
60-second period, and close to zero in the no-loss period. The other
three students turned the handle at about the same rate in all four
periods. In the second phase, instructions (i.e., rules) were added, in
the form of labels above the four amber lights, as shown in figure 8.1.

1 65

A Scientific Model of Behavior

Rule- Governed Behavior and Thinking

The label 10 SEC meant " turn the handle at least every 10 seconds,"
and the 30 SEC and 60 SEC labels meant " turn every 30 seconds" and
"turn every 60 seconds." The NO LOSS label meant " do not turn the
handle." Two additional students began the experiment in this phase.
Within three sessions, all six students now displayed appropriate rates
of handle-turning in each of the four periods. All six students' handle­
turning was now being governed by the labels. In technical terms,
all six students displayed discriminations with respect to the verbal
discriminative stimuli.
In the third phase, the labels were withdrawn. The amber lights
were shuffled with respect to the four periods, so the students would
need to rearrange their rates of handle-turning. Two of the six students
returned to turning the handle at about the same rate in all four periods.
Whereas the other four discriminated with respect to the different
amber lights as discriminative stimuli, the two discriminated only
on the basis of the verbal discriminative stimuli. Their behavior was
strictly rule-governed.
In Galizio's experiment, he was the speaker, and the students
were the listeners. Providing the labels constituted verbal behavior,
because it was reinforced by the changes in the listeners' behavior.
(Had there been no effects, Galizio would have had nothing to write
about and could not have published the article.) When the students'
behavior came under control of the verbal discriminative stimuli, it
was rule-governed.
The changes in behavior that were rule-governed, however, were
exactly the same as the changes governed by the lights. A verbal dis­
criminative stimulus controls behavior in the same way as a nonverbal
discriminative stimulus. The difference lies in the origin of the control.
Verbal discriminative stimuli depend on a long and powerful history
of rule-following that begins soon after birth. It should come as
no surprise that all the students in Galizio's experiment responded
appropriately when the rules were introduced. It is striking, however,
that some of them responded appropriately only to the rules.
Galizio's experiment illustrates also that experience with the relation
that occasions the rule need not be firsthand. Galizio need never have
turned the handle to be able to say that handle-turns need to occur at
least every 10 seconds to avoid losses. He could say this on the basis
of stimuli generated when he programmed the apparatus and when the
students operated the apparatus. Similarly, I need never have played
tennis to tell you that the ball is out if it crosses the line; I need only
have watched other people play. The discriminative stimulus or context
is still the relation, only now it involves other people's actions and
consequences.

There is one important exception: Sometimes a speaker has no
xp
e erience at all with the relation, even secondhand, but is repeating
someone else's rule-giving. Frequently we preface such statements with
"I heard" or "They say" ("I heard that you can get a better price at the
store around the corner"). This exception confirms our general principle,
because even if I am only repeating what another speaker said, the
context or discriminative stimulus for that speaker's behavior was
experience with the relation. Ultimately, the context for any utterance
we recognize as rule-giving is a reinforcement relation.
Everyday use of the word rule is narrower than the behavior ana­
lysts' technical meaning. Everyday rules fit into the category "verbal
discriminative stimuli that point to a reinforcement relation," but this
category includes also stimuli that would not ordinarily be called rules.
For example, technically speaking many orders and commands are
rules. When a parent says, "Don't play down by the railroad tracks
. . because you might get hurt," this verbal discriminative stimulus is a
rule, because the parent's verbal behavior producing it is under the
control of ( points to) the relation " If a child plays by the railroad
tracks, then getting hurt becomes more likely."
We will say that a rule "points to a relation" as shorthand for
"the verbal behavior of giving the rule is under stimulus control of
the relation." When children are told to "Just say no" to drugs, this
rule points to the relation " If one says no to drugs, then one is more
likely to avoid the bad consequences of taking them:' Often, as in this
example, the rule points implicitly to the relation because context makes
it obvious. Even the drill sergeant's commands - " Attention," "At
ease," " Left face," and so on - may be viewed as rules, because giving
them can be said to be occasioned by the relation that if a soldier
obeys the sergeant quickly and well, then that soldier is more likely to
fight effectively in battle.
All instructions are rules. The clerical trainee is told, " Keep just
one file open at a time; then you won't mix them up." When you buy
a table that requires assembly, the written instructions are rules,
impliCitly pointing to the relation that if you behave so, then you
are likely to have a useful table. Maps and diagrams count also. If I
draw you a map of how to get to my house, that instructs you in the
same way as if I told you the directions. Drawing the map constitutes
verbal behavior, the map constitutes a rule, and map-following is
rule-governed behavior.
Advice conforms to the definition of a rule. "Son, I think you should
marry Mabel; she will make a good wife and you will be happy" is a
verbal discriminative stimulus that points explicitly to a relation between
marrying women like Mabel and being happy. If the son generally

1 64

1 67

A Scientific Model of Behavior

Rule-Governed Behavior and Thinking

follows his father's advice, the likelihood of the behavior of marrying
Mabel will be increased. We pay a lot of money to brokers, lawyers,
physicians, and other experts for advice because they can point to rela­
tions (give rules or produce verbal discriminative stimuli) that we cannot.
Offers of mutual benefit sometimes constitute rules, if the benefit to
one party is deferred to the future. "If you will scratch my back, then
when your back itches I will scratch yours" points to a relation between
your behavior and a likely but deferred reinforcer. As a discriminative
stimulus it increases the chances that you will scratch my back. (We
will discuss such altruistic behavior more fully in chapter 12.)
All these examples share two features. First, since the rule implicitly
or explicitly points to a reinforcement relation, we can always restate
the rule in the form "If this activity, then this consequence becomes
likely." You can recognize a verbal discriminative stimulus as a rule
by stating it explicitly in this form. In chapter 6 we saw that discrim­
inative stimuli constitute categories such as "person in a slide" (the
pigeon experiment) or " questions about the Civil War," and rules are
no exception. Think of all the various ways a parent's verbal behavior
might give the rule " If you wear a coat when you go outside in winter,
you will be less likely to get sick"; "Put on a coat"; "Have you forgotten
something?"; "What's wrong with this picture?"; " Unh, unh, unhhh";
and so on. A rule is a functional category because all of these structural
variants are equivalent functionally.
Second, the rule always points to some "larger concern." That is, the
relation pointed to is always relatively long-term, often perceivable
only over a long time, perhaps even longer than a person's lifespan.
People are advised not to smoke because of an association between
smoking and illness that was perceived only gradually over several
decades. Americans tend to insist on the superiority of democracy
because of experience with alternatives over hundreds of years. The
whole point of a rule is to strengthen behavior that will pay off in
the long run according to the long-term, ill-defined, but all-important
relation pointed to. In this sense, it can be said that the person who
gives the rule acts in part "for the good of" the person affected, an
idea to which we will return in chapter 12.

rarely does a smoker quit the habit after being shown that it may lead
to lung cancer in 30 years or even after experiencing shortness of
breath. Something more immediate is needed to break the habit. The
rule and the proximate reinforcer, both usually supplied by the speaker,
induce and maintain the desired behavior, such as breaking a bad
habit or picking up a good one. When a child follows instructions, the
speaker - the parent or teacher - applies copious reinforcers. Later in
life, when a person is being trained to do a job or perform in a sport,
the trainer supplies reinforcers for rule-following in the form of
statements like "Good," "That's right," and "Way to go."
Figure 8.2 diagrams the two reinforcement relations of rule-governed
behavior - the proximate relation above, the ultimate relation below.
As explained in chapters 4 and 6, each relation includes a context
(discriminative stimulus, or SO) and a reinforcer (SR) for the behavior.
The notation SO:B�SR indicates that the SO increases the likelihood
of the behavior B because it sets the context in which B is likely to
produce (�) reinforcers. Most notably, both relations affect the same
behavior: one encourages it, and the other justifies it.

1 66

Always Two Relations
Rule-governed behavior always involves two relations: the long-term,
ultimate relation - the reason for the rule in the first place - and a
short-term, proximate reinforcement relation for following the rule.
Delayed consequences and ill-defined relations tend to be ineffective:

The proximate reinforcement relation
The proximate relation is the reason that behavior B is called rule­
governed. The speaker-supplied verbal discriminative stimulus is the
rule. It sets the context in which B may produce proximate reinforcers,
which are usually provided by other people, often the speaker. In the
example shown in figure 8.2, the proximate reinforcer is the speaker's
approval. When the listener complies with an order, request, or instruc­
tion, the speaker supplies approval or token reinforcers (e.g., money
or vouchers) or removes an aversive condition (a threat). Even advice,
although often called neutral, rarely is so; the father who advises his
son to marry Mabel also approves when his son does so.
The proximate relation is relatively obvious, because the reinforce­
ment is relatively frequent and immediate. This is symbolized in
figure 8.2 by the shorter arrow pointing to the proximate reinforcer.
Clear relations like this are especially important when behavior is
being trained initially. Once the desired behavior is acquired, rein­
fo rcement can be less frequent and less immediate.

The ultimate reinforcement relation
The proximate relation exists because of the ultimate relation. Though
ill-defined and long-term (symbolized by the longer arrow in figure 8.2),

Rule-Governed Behavior and Thinking

the u ltimate relation justifies the proximate relation, no matter how
tri vial or arbitrary the proximate relation might seem, because it

and disease are about. Yet people who wear shoes may have little idea
of the connection to health because they only need to know what is
socially acceptable (the proximate relation). They only need to follow
the rule.
When we examine rules in the light of the ultimate relations with
which they make contact, the connection to fitness is usually clear, even
if people in general never acknowledge it. We follow the rule "Charity
begins at home" because ultimately the welfare of children and close
relatives commands top priority for advancing one's fitness (more
precisely, the fitness of one's genes). "Love thy neighbor as thyself "
can be interpreted as encouraging cooperation among group members
that benefits every member's likely reproductive success. Other rules

ultimate relation, the signs that should govern B if the ultimate relation
took over. Bottom: an example of the relations. The speaker (say, a
parent) tells the listener (a child) to wear shoes when going outdoors.
This produces an auditory proximate SO (a rule) " Wear shoes." If the
child puts on shoes, this results in the proximate reinforcer of approval
(or avoidance of disapproval) from the parent. The ultimate relation,
which is important but obscure to the child relates putting on shoes to
the ultimate reinforcer of good health and, beyond that, likelihood of

successful reproduction. The ultimate So, which should come to control
wearing shoes, consists of conditions such as sharp stones, cold weather,
presence of parasites (e.g., hookworm), and so on.

stitch in time saves

In figure 8.2, the ultimate reinforcement relation is shown as having
its Own context (ultimate SO) and its consequences (ultimate SR), separ­
ate from the proximate relation. Health-threatening circumstances like

sharp objects, hookworm larvae, snakes, scorpions, fungi, and thorny
plants constitute the context - the ultimate SO - for wearing shoes (B),
because wearing shoes prevents injuries and illnesses that you may
get by going barefoot. The reduced likelihood of injury and illness
and the increased likelihood of surviving and reproducing constitute

the ultimate reinforcers for wearing shoes. Children are told " B e nice
to y our cousins" because cooperating (B) with relatives (ultimate SO)
enhances the fitness of shared genes (ultimate SR).

1 70

A Scientific Model of Behavior

Generally speaking, all ultimate reinforcers, aifecting fitness as
they do, relate to four broad categories of activities or outcomes:
health maintenance (including survival), gaining resources, making
and maintaining relationships with kin and friends, and reproduction
(including relationships with spouse, other sex partners, children, and
grandchildren). Collectively, these are symbolized in figure 8.2 by the
letters HRRR. All rules, and particularly the rules characteristic of a
culture, ultimately depend on relations between behavior and HRRR.
We wear shoes to maintain health, we work to gain resources, we chat
to maintain relationships with friends and family, and we date to have
sex and produce offspring. Strictly speaking, all of the other three
categories could be reduced to the fourth: the reason that health and
survival, resources, and relationships are important is that they all
support, directly or indirectly, reproduction, the essential ingredient
for evolution. (We will discuss this further in chapters 12 and 13.)
The relations to the proximate and ultimate reinforcement give the
verbal behavior of the speaker, By in figure 8.2, the dual functions of
commanding and informing. In the terms of chapter 7, stating the rule
(By) is a mand relative to the proximate relation, but is a tact relative
to the ultimate relation. The proximate reinforcer for the rule-giving
is the listener's compliance (obeying the order, following the advice).
People who post " No Smoking" signs usually do so for their own
comfort, among other reasons. If any ultimate reinforcer for the rule­
giving exists, it is entailed in the ultimate reinforcers for the listener's
rule-following. A parent's interest in a child's survival and reproduction
benefits the parent's own reproductive success. As with the behavior
of the listener, however, the relation to reproductive success is long­
term and relatively ineffective. Thus, the parent's rule-giving may be
maintained primarily by the child's compliance.
Although Galizio's experiment (figure 8.1) seems simple in com­
parison to real-world situations, it too conforms to the pattern in
figure 8.2. The proximate reinforcement relation was the relation
between following the instructions on the labels and avoiding losses.
The ultimate relation was between following the instructions and
earning close to the maximum of two dollars per session. (Avoiding
excessive effort may also have been a factor.) The labels constituted
the rules, and the experimental setting constituted the ultimate SD.
The rule and the proximate reinforcement may be temporary. If the
behavior B is strengthened enough, it will come into contact with and
be maintained by the ultimate reinforcement. Children would never
learn that wearing shoes is a good thing if they never wore shoes.
Once a child begins wearing shoes most of the time, the advantages
of wearing shoes - the ultimate reinforcement - may take over. The

Rule-Governed Behavior and Thinking

171

situation i s much like starting a car: The engine has t o b e going at
some speed before it can run on its own. The proximate reinforcement
is like the car's starter: it gets the behavior going at a rate sufficient for
the ultimate reinforcement to keep it going. In Galizio's experiment,
some of the students made the transition from the proximate to the
ultimate reinforcement relation when their appropriate responding to
the different loss relations no longer depended on the presence of the
labels. I tell my children to be honest with others in the hope that
someday they will be honest without my having to tell them.
If occasions for the rule-governed behavior are too infrequent, then
transition to the ultimate reinforcement may never occur. Perhaps that
is why some of Galizio's students never made it; they might have
eventually gotten free of the instructions with further training. When I
buy a table that requires assembly, I follow the instructions slavishly,
because this is the first and probably the only time I will assemble
this table. In contrast, someone working in a factory assembling many
tables every day soon ceases to consult the instructions. We have fire
drills and boot camp drills so that when the ultimate SD (fire or battle)
actually arises, the appropriate behavior is likely to occur; the more
realistic the practice situation, the better.
A question remains: People sometimes can say what to do but
not why. If the speaker cannot verbalize the ultimate reinforcement
relation - has no idea why the children should be good to their cousins
- then where did the rule come from? Someone had to originate it, but
only one person need ever have come into contact with the ultimate
relation, because members of a cultural group learn rules from one
another. Once that person stated the rule and taught it to offspring,
relatives, and neighbors, if the rule truly made contact with an ultimate
relation, it spread from person to person and group to group. Rule­
making, just as much as rule-following, is an integral part of human
culture. (More about that in chapters 13 and 14.)

Learning to Follow Rules
People exhibit a remarkable tendency to do as they are told. Sometimes
We wish people would be less obedient and "think for themselves"
more - especially soldiers and bureaucrats. Stanley Milgrim's famous
"obedience" experiment - in which people were willing to deliver
near-lethal electric shocks to a stranger just on the say-so of a research
psychologist - actions by Nazis in concentration camps, and actions
by US soldiers in Vietnam have shown how this obedience can go too

1 72

A Scientific Model of Behavior

far. Despite these examples, it remains true that conformity generally
pays; even the most rebellious teenager can usually be persuaded to
wear sunscreen at the beach. Why do people follow rules so readily?

Shaping Rule-Following
People may be so inclined to follow rules partly because they are
exposed to so many different proximate reinforcement relations from
such an early age. Again and again children do as they are told and win
cookies, affection, and approval. The rules are verbalized by mother,
father, other family members, and then teachers. We even have games
that teach rule-following, such as Simon Says and Mother May I?
As a result, rule-following becomes a functional category, a gener­
alized skill - so much so that we unhesitatingly follow even the dir­
ections of strangers. As it generalizes, rule-following itself becomes
partly rule-governed. Children are told, "Do as I say" and "Listen to
your elders." We form discriminations, too. ("Don't listen to Jim, he's
a liar.") In an old episode of the TV show WKRP in Cincinnati, one
character tells another, " It's bad luck to take advice from crazy people."
In a sense, this generalized rule-following makes the world go
around. Galizio capitalized on it in his experiment, assuming that'
the subjects would read and respond to the labels over the lights
(figure 8.1). Without generalized rule-following, the possibilities for
culture would be limited indeed. With it, complex practices like send­
ing children to public school or building jet airplanes can exist and be
transmitted. (More about this in chapters 13 and 14.)

Where Are the Rules?
Traditional explanations of rule-following have been mentalistic. As
with grammar, rules in general are often spoken of as if they were
possessions, as if people have them. Psychologists sometimes say
rules are "internalized." As with other forms of mentalism, the rules
that govern our behavior are supposedly somewhere inside, as if one
possessed an internal rulebook in which rules were somehow recorded
and could be looked up on appropriate occasions. The usual questions
about mentalism arise (chapter 3). Where are these inner rules? What
are they made of? How could they cause behavior? Who looks them
up and writes them down? Isn't the behavior of writing down and
looking up rules just as complicated as the behavior that they are
meant to explain? And so on.

children state the rule publicly or even privately at the time. We need
only to recognize that part of the context for the activity occurred at
an earlier time.
Second, since control by the proximate reinforcement may be
temporary, when the ultimate reinforcement takes over, the rule may
be absent, perhaps for good. When people talk about rules being
"internalized," they are probably talking about this transition. The
students in Galizio's experiment who responded appropriately after
the labels were removed might be said to have internalized the rules.
The change, however, is not from an external to an internal rule, but
from a relatively short-term reinforcement relation to a long-term one.
In Galizio's experiment, control switched from the labels to the amber
lights. When my children are nice to their cousins, their cousins are
nice to them back, with the result that my children continue to be
nice. My children have not internalized the rule that they should treat
their cousins well; instead, natural and long-term consequences now
maintain their behavior.

Thinking and Problem- Solving
Rules are often solutions to problems: "If you behave so, the situation
will resolve into such-and-such reinforcer." When faced with a problem,
We may need to formulate a rule.
People are especially likely to talk about someone "thinking" when
that person is solving a problem. The architect who is seeking the best
design for a living space or the motorist who has locked the keys in
the car may "ponder" the situation, "consider" various solutions, be
"lost in thought." The mentalist sees in such situations justification for

A Scientific Model of Behavior

Rule�Governed Behavior and Thinking

imagining complex inner processes because the person may sit still for
a while, apparently doing nothing, and then suddenly act to solve the
problem. Here is a challenge for behaviorists, then. Is it possible to
discuss problem-solving without appealing to complex inner processes?
In chapter 5, we discussed briefly the behavioral approach to
problem-solving. Mentalistic accounts focus on the suddenness of the
solution, on the " creative" or "inspirational" moment. They overlook
the long history of reinforcement prior to any particular instance
of problem-solving. Just as we learn to be listeners, we learn to be
problem-solvers. It is an essential skill for getting along in life, and
the parent or teacher who fails to help a child learn how to solve
problems is considered derelict. The motorist who locks the keys in
the car might call the police for help. This motorist has been instructed
in this sort of solution before, and perhaps has called the police before
on similar occasions of helplessness. The architect's design, too, no
matter how seemingly original, derives from training, practice, and
observation. No instance of problem-solving occurs in isolation; it is�
to be understood in the light of previous training, instruction, and .
reinforcement.
Although behaviorists agree on this general approach, they differ
a bit in their accounts. Molar behaviorists regard problem-solving
as fully integrated with previous history. We gain experience with
certain types of situations and come to act in certain ways in those
situations. Problem-solving in this perspective is only a step along the
way, and not especially significant. Someone becomes a scientist by
behaving and receiving consequences in the laboratory, in the field,
in the office, and at conferences. Solutions occur to problems with
apparatus, data, and theory, but that is all part of becoming and being
a scientist. Such behavior is rule-governed only to the extent that it
depends on previous instruction.
Skinner's (1969) molecular view, on which we will focus now, treats
problem-solving as rule-governed in another, more immediate, sense.
Since Skinner accepted the idea that talking to oneself can be considered
verbal behavior (chapter 7) - that a person can simultaneously play
the roles of speaker and listener - his account relies on the concept of
self-instruction: as speakers, giving ourselves rules as listeners.

when the solution occurs and obtains the reinforcer. When the architect
sketches a design that works (matches the requirements), enormous
satisfaction follows - not to mention money and praise from clients
an d colleagues.
While the architect is solving the problem, many sketches may cover
the desk. One possibility is tried, then another and another. One sketch
suggests the next, and features of several different sketches may be
combined into the one that finally succeeds. The behavior (sketching)
varies, but is far from random. Not only do the sketches depend on
the architect's previous training and observations, but the sketches
depend on one another.
To say that one sketch influences the next is to say that the first
sketch acts as a discriminative stimulus for making the next. The
architect makes a sketch, looks at it, concludes it doesn't work or almost
works, and then tries another. All the sketches that go before may set
the context for the final one. That they rule out some possibilities and
suggest others means that, as discriminative stimuli, they weaken some
further actions of sketching and strengthen others. The behavior of
problem-solving produces stimuli that serve to change the likelihood
of further behavior that might include the solution.
Where such behavior comes from is no mystery. In the experienced
architect, such "brain-storming" has been reinforced many times in
the past. We discussed in chapter 5 how discriminations in which past
behavior serves as part of the context are trained in porpoises and rats
as well as humans. Even though each new action may be unique, it
still relates to those that went before.
When solutions need not be original to be reinforced, similar prob­
lems tend to be solved similarly as long as such solutions continue
to pay off. Many psychology textbooks describe an experiment by
A. C. Luchins, who had people solve series of problems like that shown
in table 8.1. Each problem presented three imaginary jars of water,
with the capacities shown for Jar A, Jar B, and Jar C, and required for
solution a sequence of pourings that would lead one jar to contain the
amount shown in the last column. The first three problems are solved
by subtracting one A and two Cs from B. Problems 4 and 5 can also be
solved this way, but can be solved more simply by subtracting C from
A. Problem 6 can be solved only by subtracting C from A. Luchins
found that problems 4 and 5 were nearly always solved in the more
complicated manner of problems 1-3, and that most of the people in
the experiment failed to solve problem 6.
Mentalistic attempts to explain Luchins's results attribute them to a
" mental set" or "cognitive set." Supposedly the person forms this set
internally while solving the first three problems, and then the set causes

1 74

Changing Stimuli
As we saw in chapter 5, situations we identify as problems are those
in which the reinforcer - the successful outcome - is apparent, but the
required behavior - the solution - is obscure. The problem is resolved

the person to continue solving the problems accordingly. This set
also supposedly prevents solution of the sixth problem. As we saw in
chapter 3, the behaviorist asks where the set is supposed to be, what
it is made of, and how it affects behavior. The set only labels the
observation that needs to be explained: the persistence of a certain
pattern of behavior ( here, B-A-2C). It is worse than no explanation '
because it gives an appearance of explanation that distracts us from
finding a true explanation (see chapter 3).
Behavior analysts, who seek explanations in the natural world of
behavior and environment, see the situation another way. As each of
the first three problems is solved, a pattern of behavior (B-A-2C) is
reinforced. This pattern provides a discriminative stimulus - a verbal
discriminative stimulus if the pattern is stated "B-A-2C," or a visual
stimulus if the pattern is seen as a sequence of imagined actions. This
discriminative stimulus controls behavior in the subsequent problems.
The history of reinforcement for the B-A-2C pattern combined with
the similar appearance of all the problems, ensures that for each new
problem B-A-2C will be the first action to occur. Solutions that omit B
(e.g., A-C) will be unlikely and will occur only after a lot of patterns
involving B, if they occur at all.
The difference between Luchins's subjects, who got into a rut, and
the creative architect lies in their histories of reinforcement. Problem­
solving becomes stereotyped or creative and original, depending on
whether the same pattern is reinforced over and over or novel patterns
are reinforced.
The only unusual aspect of these explanations is that the discrim­
inative stimuli that strengthen possible solutions arise from the
problem-solver's own behavior. Just as Luchins's subjects might have

1 77

talked to themselves about the jar problems, the architect might also
talk to himself or herself, saying things like What if the kitchen were
here? or Suppose we move this bedroom upstairs ? Playing speaker, the
architect is generating verbal discriminative stimuli (like the rule in
figure 8.2) that then change the likelihood of certain further behavior
on his or her part as listener. The variation in action that eventually
leads to the solution comes from the architect's own verbal behavior.
When I am trying to solve a problem, I may talk to myself out loud
or privately. Talking to oneself inaudibly is commonly called "think­
ing." If my car fails to start, I may say to myself, Perhaps I should press
on the accelerator. Whether I say it out loud or privately, the behavior
generates a verbal discriminative stimulus (as in figure 8.2) that makes
it more likely that I will press on the accelerator. The person who sits
quietly and then " suddenly" solves a problem may have gone through
a whole process of privately saying things and visualizing results, one
after another. Regardless of whether the process went on overtly or
. ' covertly, it can still be understood as speaker-activity alternating with
listener-activity.

Pre current Behavior
Skinner (1969) called the speaker-activity that generates discriminative
stimuli precurrent, meaning that it goes before the solution. Precurrent
activity allows problem-solving (listener-activity) to vary systematically
rather than randomly. Although random variation may be helpful,
as jiggling and twisting the key in a worn lock eventually opens the
door, problem-solving is usually systematic in that attempts at solu­
tion follow patterns, particularly patterns that have worked before. I
may never have been lost in this particular neighborhood before, but
I have a history of consulting maps and deriving possible routes I behave in ways that succeeded (i.e., were reinforced) in the past. The
precurrent behavior involved is often called reasoning, imagining,
hypothesizing, and so on. All of these share the property of generating
discriminative stimuli that change the likelihood of further activities.
When you looked at the first problems in table 8.1, you might have
said things to yourself like The water has to be poured out of Jar B, because
the amoun t required is larger than A or C and What's the difference between
B and D ? This would be precurrent behavior, because when you heard
Yourself, you likely behaved accordingly.
Like other behavior-analytic concepts, the idea of precurrent behavior
cuts across traditional distinctions. Sometimes it coincides with what
people call thinking or reasoning or brain-storming, but not always. If

A Scientific Model of Behavior

Rule-Governed Behavior and Thinking

we accept the idea that the same person can act simultaneously as
speaker and listener, then precurrent activity would conform to the
definition of verbal behavior and the stimuli generated would be rules.
Indeed, this almost seems obvious when we talk to ourselves out lOud
in attempting to solve problems. Precurrent behavior, however, can
be private or public, vocal or nonvocal. When someone working on a
jigsaw puzzle picks up a piece and turns it this way and that, even­
tually finding a place for it, that is precurrent behavior - public and
nonvocal. If, when trying to decide on a color scheme for a house, I
hold up color chips and imagine the house painted those colors, that
could be called precurrent behavior, partly private and nonvocal.
The connection between precurrent behavior and rule-governed
behavior lies in the discriminative stimuli generated. Precurrent beha­
vior is like rule-making. We might stop short of saying they are exactly
the same because, according to our definition, to qualify as a rule a
discriminative stimulus must be generated by behavior under the con­
trol of an ultimate reinforcement relation acting as a discriminative
stimulus. It may be stretching a point to say that a match of shapes
generated by manipulating a puzzle piece should be called a rule.
The key insight gained by defining precurrent behavior is that
problem-solving is like rule-governed behavior. No new principles
need be invented to understand how people surmount everyday dif­
ficulties or how they act " creatively." The explanations we have con­
sidered are sketchy and require further research, but the point is
made: scientific accounts of rule-making, rule-following, thinking, and
problem-solving are all possible.

rule-following excludes relations that are never spoken of, because
they define a rule as a verbal discriminative stimulus that points to a
reinforcement relation. Points to a relation means "is given by verbal
behavior under stimulus control by a relation acting as a discrimina­
tive stimulus." This definition includes most examples that people
w ould consider rules, but more besides. Requests and orders often
qualify, particularly when they can be viewed as offers or threats.
Instructions and advice also qualify.
The relation pointed to by a rule (the ultimate relation) is always
long-term or ill-defined, but important in that it affects health and
survival, gaining of resources, relationships (particularly with relatives
and friends), and reproduction (HRRR; i.e., determining fitness in the
long run). The rule is associated with a more immediate reinforcement
rela tion (the proximate relation), providing reinforcers like approval
and money, that helps to bring behavior into contact with the ultimate
reinforcement. Children are taught to follow rules - to be obedient because of the ultimate relations, and acquiring this generalized skill
is a part of growing up in a culture. When people learn generalized
rule-following, however, they acquire only a discrimination - their
actions come under control by a certain category of verbal discrim­
inative stimuli from a certain category of speakers. To imagine that
the rules somehow move inside is mentalism. The rules are in the
environment.
1£ we accept the idea that talking to oneself is verbal behavior - that
one person can simultaneously play the roles of speaker and listener
- then problem-solving may be understood as an example of rule­
governed behavior. The person's behavior generates discriminative
stimuli, often interpretable as rules, that increase the likelihood of
further actions that may include the " solution" - the action that is
reinforced. The behavior that produces the stimuli is called precurrent.
It may be public or private, vocal or nonvocal, and it functions like
self-instruction. In particular, the "thinking" that goes on during
problem-solving can be understood as precurrent behavior, usually
private and vocal.

1 78

Summary
Making and following rules are two of the most important activities
in human life and culture. The things called rules, whether spoken or
written, are verbal discriminative stimuli. They govern our behavior
in the same way that discriminative stimuli control our behavior.
They are verbal because they are generated by verbal behavior on the
part of a speaker. The one who follows the rule is a listener and, as
a listener, reinforces the speaker's giving the rule. Rule-governed ·
behavior may be distinguished from implicitly shaped behavior, which
arises directly from contact with reinforcement relations. Although
people sometimes regard complicated implicitly shaped performances
as rule-following, the rule stated is really only a brief summary of the
performance. In contrast, behavior analysts' more technical concept of

Part Three

Social Issues

The areas of application for behavior analysis and behavioral thinking
are broad and diverse. Pick any aspect of human existence, and you
. . will find that behaviorism shows it in a new perspective. Politics,
government, law, education, economics, international relations, and
preserving the environment all take on a fresh appearance.
Our social problems are behavioral problems. They all concern get­
ting people to behave better - to govern well, to obey the law, to learn
in school, to recycle trash. How should we get people to behave
appropriately, and what is appropriate behavior, anyway? Traditional
approaches to these thorny questions have almost always been men­
talistic and thus of little help. Can behavior analysts do better?
Part Three offers few definite answers, but instead offers a fresh
approach - the behavioral approach. It aims to demonstrate that
behavior analysis can help solve the world's problems. The absence of
simple or definite solutions need discourage no one, because behavioral
thinking allows us to frame our problems in ways that can lead to
solutions. Half the work of solving a problem is seeing it in the right
terms. Trying to change behavior without the concepts of reinforce­
ment, induction, and stimulus control is like trying to create new chem­
icals and materials without atomic theory.
Behaviorists have written a great deal about social issues, and the
results have been mixed. For instance, John B. Watson wrote pro­
lifically for the popular press, but was probably of little help to his
readers because relatively little was known about behavior in the 1920s
and 1930s. Much more is understood about behavior now. When
B. F. Skinner wrote Beyond Freedom and Dignity in 1971, he had new
concepts to draw on. Part Three covers much the same ground as
Skinner's book, but expands and updates to include the thinking that
has occurred since then.

Chapter 9

Freedom

As we did with other terms, so we can do with the word free - to
understand what it means, we examine how it is used. As we saw in
chapter 1, only the notion of free will actually conflicts with behaviorism.
Most uses of the word can be understood in behavioral terms.

Uses of the Word Free
Free is used in three ways. First, people speak of freedom from restraint,
as in becoming free from slavery. This is often spoken of as being free,
suggesting that freedom is an attribute or possession. The extension of
this idea is the notion of free will, which implies that a person has the
freedom to behave without regard to past or present environment.
Second, people speak of political and social freedom. Here the issue
is not so much constraint as having to face unpleasant consequences
for certain choices. Persecution for your beliefs means not that you
cannot act in accordance with them, but that you are punished for
doing so. That is when we speak of lack of religious or political
freedom, and we say we do not feel free. Third, people - particularly
religiously minded people - speak of spiritual freedom. When a church
advertises that "Jesus will free you from bondage," no lack of free will
or political or religious freedom is suggested, but rather deliverance
from a metaphorical prison. We will take these uses up in turn.

Being Free: Free will
Someone who is freed from jail has had a physical restraint removed.
Locked in a cell, the person cannot go out. Opening the cell door is

Social Issues

Freedom

like opening a cage door; "free as a bird" means the person is able to
move about unfettered.
This particular type of being free presents no problem for behavior
analysis, because it refers only to whether an action is possible. It is
like saying that when the lever is removed, the rat is not free to press,
and when the lever is inserted the rat is free to press.
As constraints go, jails and cages are only the most obvious. You
never chose freely to breathe, walk, or even learn to talk. These were
constrained by your genes and environment. Were it possible to be
free from such constraints, then we would have free will.
In chapter 1, we discussed problems with the notion of free will.
Apart from philosophical and aesthetic considerations, the results of
public policies based on an assumption of free will usually range from
poor to disastrous. The assumption is often used as a justification for
doing nothing. If cocaine addicts are free to choose not to take the
drug, then the addiction seems to be the addicts' fault, that they should
just "pull themselves together," and that no help need be given:
We seem slowly to be learning that wise policies cannot assume '
free will. To say that people growing up in urban slums choose to be
ignorant and unemployed is useless and self-serving. Some small-scale
projects in urban high schools have succeeded in keeping students in
school, and job-training has gotten people back to work and off the
welfare roll. These projects succeeded because they created reinforce­
ment relations and backed them up with encouragement and explana­
tions (rules in the sense of chapter 8).
Behavior analysts argue that as long as we go on assuming free will,
we will fail to solve our social problems. If, however, we move forward
in a frankly behavioral framework and try to change problematic beha'"
vior, then our focus will shift to questions about which methods to
use. Skinner argued in favor of positive reinforcement, for two reasonSI
First, it is highly effective. Second (and important to our discussion
of freedom), when people's behavior is shaped and maintained by
positive reinforcement, people do not feel coerced; they feel free.

People who live in a police state are also said to lack freedom because
many of their activities are prohibited by threat of punishment. They
cannot feel free, as most of us who live in a democratic society do. We
feel free to criticize our rulers in public because they cannot punish us
for doing so.
The key obstacle to feeling free is coercion. People cannot feel free
when they are coerced - that is, when their behavior is controlled by
the threat at aversive consequences.

1 84

Feeling Free: Political and Social Freedom
Another example of people who are said to lack freedom is slaves.
Slaves' lack of freedom has less to do with physical restraint, because
a slave can refuse to work. The likely consequence of such refusal,
however, would be a beating. Someone who cooperates because of
threatened punishment may in principle be free to defy the threat, but
does not feel free to do so.

1 85

Coercion and aversive control
In chapter 4, I defined the two types of aversive control, positive
punishment and negative reinforcement. If speaking out results in a
beating, then speaking out is positively punished. If lying avoids a
beating, then lying is negatively reinforced. The two tend to go hand
in hand, because if one activity is punished, usually some alternative
activity will avoid punishment.
Figure 9.1 illustrates the relationship involved in coercion. When
an overseer holds a whip and tells the slave to work, the slave's work­
ing is negatively reinforced by preventing a whipping. The steps in
between involve an interaction between the overseer (controller) and
the slave (controllee). Waving the whip, or the threatening behavior
(BT), produces a discriminative stimulus for the slave (S�), which would
usually be called a threat. The threat-stimulus sets the occasion for
compliance (Be) - working or "doing what the boss wants." Since the
controllee's compliance produces a positive reinforcer (S�) - say, get­
ting the crops harvested - for the controller, the controller's threaten­
ing behavior is positively reinforced as a result of the controllee's

1 86

Freedom

activity. As long as the slave works and positively reinforces the over­
seer's threatening behavior, the overseer holds back on the whip. This
means that the positive reinforcer - the controller's goal - acts also as
a discriminative stimulus (sg) that sets the context for the controller's
not punishing (NO Bp) or withholding the punisher (Bw). The con­
sequence for the controllee is no punisher (NO SP) or the negative
reinforcer of avoiding it (Sfv).
Figure 9.1 resembles figure 7.1, the diagram of a verbal episode.
The controller's threatening behavior is like verbal behavior; to be
reinforced, it requires a listener - the controllee. When two people
reinforce one another's behavior, as shown in figures 9.1 and 7.1, we
can say that they have a relationship. We will explore relationships
more generally in chapter 11.
Figure 9.1 shows the key defining features of coercion: positive rein­
forcement of the controller's behavior paired with negative reinforce­
ment of the controllee's behavior. Whenever this asymmetry exists, the
controllee is said to be coerced, to lack freedom, and not to feel free.
All sorts of relationships can be coercive. A parent may threaten
spanking or disapproval to get a child to obey. A teacher may threaten
a student with bad grades or public humiliation. One spouse may
threaten the other with yelling or removal of affection or of sex. An
employer may threaten an employee with disapproval, humiliation,
or job loss.
All these coercive relationships can be replaced with noncoercive
ones. The parent can give affection or treats when the child obeys. The
teacher can give good grades or approval when the student performs.
Spouses can reward one another with affection, sympathy, and help.
Employers can reinforce good performance with tokens of approval
(certificates, badges, office furniture) and money. Why, then, do people
so often resort to coercion?
The main reason is that coercion usually works. Those who suggest
that coercion is ineffective are mistaken, because, trained properly,
human beings are exquisitely sensitive to potential aversive con­
sequences, particularly disapproval and social isolation. Every culture
has its taboos, and most members of any cultural group learn to avoid
transgressing on pain of disapproval and rejection. Even a threat as
remote as jail suffices to keep most of us in line. The minority who
wind up in jail usually lacked childhood training with positive social
reinforcers and rules about long-term aversive consequences - that
is, they received little affection or approval for good actions and no
reinforcers for rule-following.
The trouble with coercion lies in its long-term consequences for the
person controlled and, eventually, for the controller. In the long run, a

family or a society that relies on coerc;ion to keep some of its members
in line will suffer nasty side effects. The most salient are resentment,
anger, and aggression.
People who are controlled by aversive means not only cannot feel
free: but tend to be resentful, angry, and aggressive. Evolutionary his­
tory probably has a lot to do with this because natural selection would
favor individuals that responded aggressively to the two chief tools of
coercion, pain and loss of resources. One sure way to induce aggress­
ive behavior in many species, including ours, is to inflict pain. Two
peaceful rats begin to fight almost immediately when they are given
electric shocks. Thus, it should come as no surprise that people in jail
tend to violence. Loss of resources (i.e., loss of positive reinforcement)
also induces aggression in many species, including humans. One has
only to stop feeding one pigeon to have it move to attack another
standing near. Sibling rivalry can be vicious in families where affec­
tion is scarce.
As a way of dealing with people, then, coercion is bad because it
makes people angry, aggressive, and resentful. In a word, it makes
them unhappy, and unhappy controllees eventually behave in ways
that are aversive for the controllers. Disaffection eventually leads to
noncooperation and revolt. The child runs away or engages in self­
destructive behavior. The marriage breaks up. The employee steals
from the company, sabotages projects, or quits. Someone who feels
trapped in a coercive relationship shows all the signs of unhappiness.
Someone who feels free is happy.

187

Freedom and happiness
Speaking of political or social freedom, people often say that freedom
means having choices. To the behavior analyst, "having choices" has
nothing to do with free will; it means only that more than one activity
is possible. Does social freedom consist of having choices - of being
able to vote for the candidate of one's choice or attend the church of
one's choice?
Our discussion of coercion suggests that social freedom consists not
so much of having choices as of not being punished for one's choices.
I may choose to belong to a political party or a religion that is out­
lawed; we say my political or religious freedom is restricted because I
will be punished .
The conditions under which we feel free turn out to be identical
with the conditions under which we feel happy. How much sweeter
it is to work for wages than to avoid the whip! Most people would

Social Issues

Freedom

rather play the state lottery than pay state taxes. We feel both free and
happy when we behave one way rather than another - belong to one
group rather than another, work at one task rather than another - not
because the unchosen action is punished, but because the chosen
action is more positively reinforced.
Rarely, of course, does a choice result in unmixed agreeable results.
Most social situations present a mixed bag. The person who says he or
she feels trapped but happy in a marriage is saying that, on the whole,
the positive reinforcement for staying in the relationship outweighs
any aversive control (coercion) in the relationship. Citizens accept
restrictions such as having to register cars and pay taxes if, on the
whole, good-citizen behavior is positively reinforced. We will discuss
relationships and government further in chapter 1 1 . For now, we stop
with the observation that the less our behavior is shaped by punish­
ment and the threat of punishment - the more our choices are guided
by positive reinforcement - the more we feel both free and happy.

had experience with similar things. You may never have been to the
Caribbean, but you have been on vacations and other trips. You gen­
eralize across the category "vacations and fun trips." In addition, some­
one (perhaps a friend or a TV advertisement) is telling you about the
Caribbean, saying, "Go to the Caribbean and have fun." In other words,
someone is producing verbal discriminative stimuli (rules) that make
it likely you will behave with respect to Caribbean vacations as you
do toward other "vacations and fun trips."
As with creativity and problem-solving, to understand desire beha­
vior analysts point to histories of reinforcement rather than posit mental
representations. After all, where did the inner desire itself come from?
The second objection to the behaviorists' account of social freedom
- that it is naive - arises from a skepticism about the benignity of
positive reinforcement. Granting controllers the means for positive
reinforcement might seem to grant them power that would be easily
abused. After all, critics say, the power to confer is also the power to
withhold. Just as an employer might coerce employees with the threat
of losing their livelihood, a government with the power to reinforce
behavior with the necessities of life could coerce citizens with the
threat of withholding them . .
The answer to this objection requires a more careful discussion of
the difference between reinforcers and punishers. In chapter 4, we
noticed that sometimes the distinction seems arbitrary. Is getting sick
a punisher or is staying healthy a reinforcer? Do I eat a good diet to
avoid getting sick (negative reinforcement) or to keep healthy (positive
reinforcement)? If I eat too much and feel ill is my overeating punished
positively by the illness or negatively by the loss of feeling well?
Fining people for misbehavior would seem to qualify as negative
punishment, and yet people behave as if a fine is an aversive event maybe not as bad as breaking an arm, but along the same line.
These are all questions about norms, or the usual state of affairs in
individuals' lives. Someone who is normally healthy regards a sore
throat as an aversive event, whereas someone suffering from cancer
would gladly exchange that illness for a sore throat.
Human beings show a remarkable ability to adapt to their normal
circumstances. This is why rich people are no happier than anyone
else. When we have money, we get used to it. Even if you live in
excess, if you are accustomed to owning three houses and two yachts,
losing one of the yachts still seems like a disaster. Once you have
adapted to a certain affluence, having some of your wealth taken away
seems a truly aversive event.
This adaptation to the norm can be understood as an establishing
condition, akin to deprivation and satiation. In chapter 4, we noted

Objections to the behavioral view
Critics raise a number of objections to the behavior analysts' view at
social freedom. We will consider two that seem particularly relevant:
(1) that the view cannot be correct because of the nature of desire and
(2) that the view is naive.
The first objection derives from the idea that freedom consists of
being able to " do what I want." In chapter 5, I dealt with terms like '
want, which seem to refer to the future or some ghostly representation
in the present, by pointing out that you say you want or desire some­
thing when you are inclined to act so as to have that thing. The some­
thing is a reinforcer, and the wanting - the inclination to act - occurs ,
in a context in which the reinforcer has been produced in the past.
One of the forms of verbal action that children learn earliest is "I
want X." As a mand, this is reinforced with X or the opportunity to act
to obtain X. Eve tells her mother she wants a cookie, and her mother
either hands her one or tells her to take one. Generally speaking, a
person would say " I want X" when the listener is likely to assist some­
how - say, with money or advice.
But, you can desire things that you have never experienced, runs on
the objection. You can say you want a Caribbean vacation even if you
have never been to the Caribbean. How could a history of reinforce­
ment account for that?
Two factors account for wanting the novel thing: generalization and
ruIes. You are only inclined to say you want something if you have

that reinforcers and punishers wax and wane in strength according to
the state of affairs prevailing in the recent past. Someone who is well
fed is unlikely to find food a powerful reinforcer. In the same way, a
rich person's behavior is less affected by the possibility of gaining or
losing a hundred dollars than a poor person's, just as if the rich person
were relatively satiated and the poor person relatively deprived. Loss
of money (a fine) becomes aversive when a person gets used to having
money, but the amount of the fine has to reflect the person's resources
to be effective. If set too high, the fine is umealistic because you can't
get blood out of a stone; if set too low, it is insignificant. Thus, fines
usually tend to a level at which, relative to most people's accustomed
resources, the threat of loss seems both realistic and nontrivial.
Control of people's behavior by threats of losing accustomed com­
fort constitutes coercion just as surely as control by threats of torture.
It is true that the power to confer is also the power to withhold, and
that such power can be abused. When it is abused, however, people
will feel neither free nor happy.
Positive reinforcement means making available relations by which
socially desirable behavior can lead to an improvement in an indi­
vidual's lot. Some American industries are learning that the way to
produce quality products is to reward workers for their efforts to'
improve quality. The extra cost is more than offset by the increased
quality, and the workers are happier, too. Some communities have
tried rewarding drivers for good driving instead of punishing them
for violations. How differently we would feel about highway police if
they occasionally pulled us over and gave us money for driving within
the speed limit! It would save the state money, because fewer clerks
would be needed and less time would be taken up in traffic court, and
people might well be more inclined to obey the speed limit.
One problem with positive reinforcement, however, is that it can by
used abusively. Small, conspicuous reinforcers delivered immediately
can be so powerful that people sacrifice long-term welfare for short­
term gain. Such a situation could be called a reinforcement trap.

night and i s a nervous wreck, w e are more inclined t o say she is
trapped in a bad habit.
Bad habits like smoking and overeating are said to require self­
control. This seems to suggest controlling a self somewhere inside or a
sel� inside controlling external behavior. Behavior analysts reject such
views as mentalistic. Instead, they ask, "What is the behavior that
people call 'self-control'?"
Self-control consists of making a choice. The smoker who refrains
from smoking exhibits self-control. The alternative, giving in to the
habit, is acting impulsively. The smoker faces a choice between two
alternatives: impulsiveness (smoking) and self-control (refraining). The
difference between the two is that impulsiveness consists of behaving
according to short-term reinforcement (enjoying a cigarette), whereas
self-control consists of behaving according to long-term reinforcement
(enjoying good health).
Figure 9.2 illustrates a reinforcement trap. The upper diagram shows
the trap in general terms. Acting impulsively (BI) leads to a small
but relatively immediate reinforcer (SR) . A short arrow symbolizes the
relative immediacy of the reinforcer and the short-term nature of the

Reinforcement traps and self-control
People recognize reinforcement traps when they talk about some­
one being a "slave to a habit." Bad habits, particularly addictions, are
hard to give up, and when someone experiences the nasty effects of
the habit, that person neither appears nor feels free. When Shona is
smoking and appears relaxed, we may say that she simply enjoys
smoking, but when she has run out of cigarettes in the middle of the

behavior-consequence relation. The short-term reinforcer for smok_
ing, shown in the lower diagram, lies in the effects of nicotine and
social reinforcers such as appearing grown-up or sophisticated. The
trouble with impulsive behavior lies in long-term ill effects, symbolized
by the large punisher (SP). The long arrow indicates that the punish­
ment for impulsiveness is substantially delayed and that the behavior_
consequence relation is only apparent in the long term. It may be
months or years before the bad habit takes its toll in consequences such
as cancer, heart disease, and emphysema, shown in the lower diagram
as the long-term effects of smoking. The large size of the symbol indic­
ates that the long-term ill effects are much more significant than the
short-term reinforcers. They are both major and relatively enduring in
comparison with the short-term consequences. Often, to make matters
worse, the long-term consequences are incremental; because we usu­
ally gain and lose weight and debt gradually, we usually don't notice
the gains and loses until they have accumulated over time.
In figure 9.2, B5 symbolizes the alternative to impulsiveness, self­
control. In the lower diagram, this is shown as refraining from smok­
ing, although it might include specific alternatives such as chewing
gum. Like impulsiveness, the behavior of self-control leads to both
short-term and long-term consequences. The short-term consequenceS, '
shown by the short arrow, are punishing but relatively minor and short­
lived: withdrawal symptoms (e,g" headaches) and possibly social dis­
comfort. In the long run (long arrow), however, self-control leads to a
major and enduring reinforcer (large SR). Refraining from smoking
reduces the risk of cancer, heart disease, and emphysema; ultimately it
promotes health,
In Rachlin's terms (chapter 3), to say someone is a smoker is to
say that the person smokes frequently, that the pattern of his or her
daily activities includes the activity of smoking. To say that someonE),
refrains from smoking is to say that the person's pattern of daily
activities omits smoking, Since the daily pattern that omits smoking
entails immediate temporary punishment, quitting is likely to need
some sort of short-term reinforcers to offset the punishment. Although
the ex-smoker will eventually enjoy long-term health, the delay to
long-term health and its incremental nature make it a relatively
ineffective consequence. Social reinforcers like approval from family,
friends, and coworkers, delivered at various times throughout the day
when the person is seen not smoking, strengthen the daily pattern of
refraining.
A second category of reinforcement traps is postponement and pro­
crastination. When someone with a small cavity postpones going to the
dentist, the immediate discomfort of having the cavity filled prevails

over the delayed greater punisher of eventually having toothaches
and a root canal or loss of the tooth. In the terms of figure 9.2, post­
ponement constitutes impulsiveness (B1) and going to the dentist con­
stitutes self-control (B5)' Postponement is reinforced immediately by
avoidance of minor discomfort, but is punished ultimately by major
dis�omfort. Going to the dentist is punished immediately by minor
discomfort, but reinforced ultimately by avoidance of major discom­
fort and by retention of usable teeth.
A third common example of a reinforcement trap is the conflict
between spending and saving. In the short run, spending (impulsive­
ness) is reinforced immediately by small purchases. In the long run,
saving (self-control) eventually produces much greater and long-lived
reinforcers, such as owning a car or house. Compulsive spenders are
people who have become trapped by the immediate reinforcement of
spending. We regard compulsive spending as a bad habit or even an
addiction because in the long run it is punished by the loss of major
reinforcers.
Situations like those diagrammed in figure 9.2 are called traps for
two reasons. First, the person behaving impulsively is trapped by the
immediate small reinforcement for impulsiveness and the immediate
small punishment for self-control. Delay weakens the effect of any
consequence. Small immediate consequences overpower even an out­
come as big as dying from cancer if the outcome is in the distant
future. Second, the large punisher for impulsiveness is recognized and
talked about. More technically, the long-term punishment acts as a
discriminative stimulus for verbal behavior that includes words like
trap and slave. Before all the discussion of the connection between
smoking and cancer, smoking was viewed more benignly; some
people called it a bad habit, but nothing like today.
Recognition of the aversive consequences of impulsiveness explains
why people caught in reinforcement traps are unhappy and do not
feel free. Insofar as the long-term punishment acts as a threat and self­
control is seen as avoidance of the threat, a reinforcement trap resem­
bles coercion. If the trapped person hears someone, even possibly
himself or herself, talk about the long-term dangers of smoking (S�
in figure 9.1), then self-control becomes like compliance (although, of
course, the punisher for failing to comply is delivered by the natural
connection between smoking and disease, rather than by a controller).
Reinforcement traps conform to the general rule that people feel trapped
and unhappy when the behavior they would otherwise prefer creates
a threat of punishment. Someone who escapes from a reinforcement
trap, like someone who escapes from coercion, feels free and happy.
Ask anyone who has kicked an addiction.

Freedom

It is no accident that the long-term consequences in figure 9.2
resemble the ultimate consequences we discussed in chapter 8 and
diagrammed in figure 8.2. Many of the verbal discriminative stimuli
called rules and the proximate reinforcement relations that go with
them exist precisely to help people to avoid reinforcement traps. When
a parent tells a child to refuse illicit drugs when they are offered, the
point of the order is to keep the child from suffering the long-term
consequences of addiction. The proximate social reinforcers from the
parent for rule-following offset the relatively immediate reinforcers
for taking the drugs that would draw the child into the trap. Viewed
this way, many cultural practices appear to be trap-avoidance. Wear­
ing shoes, the example in chapter 8, resembles self-control, because
we tolerate the immediate inconvenience of putting on shoes for the
sake of the long-term reinforcer of avoiding illness. Without cultural
support in the form of rules, people might go barefoot (impulsively)
for short-term convenience and suffer delayed dire consequences. We
will return to this point in chapter 12 when we consider how behavior
reinforced in the long term is labeled " good," whereas behavior rein­
forced in the short term is labeled "bad," and in chapter 13, on culture,
when we see how cultural practices evolve in response to ultimate .
consequences.
Without the protection of rules and rule-following, the ease with
which controllees fall into reinforcement traps presents a temptation
to controllers. The way for controllers to use positive reinforcement
abusively is to set reinforcement traps for controllees. We all dis­
approve of the drug pusher who offers free samples to children, but
what about governments that set reinforcement traps? Crafty state
legislatures resort to lotteries to raise revenue knowing that people
who hate taxes will happily play the state lottery even though they
can ill afford it. A government that takes advantage of a weakness
like this is exploitive. Since the issues involved have more to do with
management than with freedom, the discussion of exploitation will
wait until chapter 11.
The notion of a reinforcement trap helps us to understand some
instances of failing to feel free and of getting free. It may help us also
to understand another use of the word free, one that appears to differ
from those I have discussed so far: spiritual freedom.

able to attend the church of your choice. Instead, the focus is on the
world, worldly goods, and worldly comforts. People are urged to break
free from bondage or attachment or slavery to worldly pleasures. The
Indian spiritual leader Meher Baba (1987), for example, taught, "One
important condition of spiritual freedom is freedom from all wanting"
(p. 341). He continued:

1 94

Spiritual Freedom
Religious figures throughout the ages have talked about spiritual free­
dom. Such talk has nothing to do with social freedom, such as being

Man seeks worldly objects of pleasure and tries to avoid things that
bring pain, without realizing that he cannot have the one and eschew
the other. As long as there is attachment to worldly objects of pleasure,
he must perpetually invite upon himself the suffering of not having
them - and the suffering of losing them after having got them. Lasting
detachment . . . brings freedom from all desires and attachments . . .
(pp. 391-2)

This idea of freedom from attachment to worldly things finds
its place in literature also. In the novel Siddhartha (1951), Hermann
Hesse describes the central character's impressions on first seeing the
Buddha:
The Buddha went quietly on his way, lost in thought. His peaceful
countenance was neither happy nor sad. He seemed to be smiling gen­
tly inwardly. With a secret smile, not unlike that of a healthy child, he
walked along, peacefully, quietly. He wore his gown and walked along
exactly like the other monks, but his face and his step, his peaceful
downward glance, his peaceful downward-hanging hand, and every
finger of his hand spoke of peace, spoke of completeness, sought noth­
ing, imitated nothing, reflected a continuous quiet, an unfading light, an
invulnerable peace. (pp. 27-8)

Nor is this linking of spiritual freedom to escape from worldly
desires confined to books about religion. In the novel Free Fall (1959)
by William Golding, the central character at one point finds himself on
his bicycle near to the home of Beatrice, with whom he is in love:
And even by the time I was on the bike by the traffic light, I was no
longer free . . . For this part of London was touched by Beatrice. She saw
this grime-smothered and embossed bridge; the way buses heaved over
its arch must be familiar. One of these streets must be hers, a room
in one of these drab houses. I knew the name of the street, Squadron
Street; knew, too, that sight of the name, on a metal plaque, or sign­
posted might squeeze my heart small again, take away the strength of
my knees, shorten my breath. I sat my bike on the downward slope of
the bridge, waiting for a green light and the roll down round to the left;
and already I had left my freedom behind me. (p. 79)

Social Issues

Freedom

Here again the sense of freedom is opposed to the sense of wanting,
attachment, or desire. Although Golding does not call the freedom
"spiritual," it is clear he would equate it with the absence of the desire
for Beatrice.
"Worldly pleasures" - food, sex, nice cars, Caribbean vacations _
these are reinforcers. In technical terms, these writers seem to be
talking about something beyond freedom from aversive control; they
seem to be talking about freedom even from positive reinforcement. If
one could be free of aversive control and positive reinforcement, what
control would be left? Does talk of spiritual freedom necessarily imply
that people can get free of all control? Can behaviorists make any
sense of such talk?
A way to understand spiritual freedom becomes clearer when we
consider not only what is being denigrated but also what is being
advocated. If pursuing worldly pleasure is bad, then what is good?
Answers vary, but they generally advocate values like kindness and
simplicity. Help others even at your own discomfort. Eat to live
instead of living to eat. Give up selfishness and excess.
From a behavioral perspective, such injunctions point to deferred
aversive consequences. Selfishness and high living may pay off in the
short run, but in the long run, they lead to loneliness, illness, and
remorse. In the long run, you'll be happier if you help others and live
moderately. Such long-term reinforcement relations are just the sort
that have little effect on behavior without rules and rule-following.
"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you" is a rule that
makes it likely our social behavior will come into contact with the
long-term advantages of helping others.
Kindness and simplicity pay off with more than just avoiding
sorrow; they have their positive reinforcers, too. We benefit from
mutually helpful relationships with others, and moderation usually
leads to improved health, and advocates of spiritual freedom point
also to less tangible rewards.
This is especially clear in the quote above from Hermann Hesse.
The word peace appears in the passage five times. The Buddha's
detachment means attaining inner calm, tranquility, relief from the
anxieties of pursuing worldly aims, getting off the emotional roller
coaster of despair and elation. Meher Baba was the one who taught,
" Don't worry, be happy."
In behavioral terms, advocating spiritual freedom can be seen, not
as arguing for freedom from all positive reinforcement, but rather
as arguing for one set of positive reinforcers against another. It is
about quality of life. "Eat to live" and "moderation in all things" do
not mean one should give up food, sex, clothes, or cars; they mean

that those reinforcers should not be the main or only reinforcers in
one's life.
The argument resembles the reasoning about reinforcement traps
illustrated in figure 9.2. Worldly reinforcers for selfishness and self­
indulgence, which would be analogous to impulsiveness, are relatively
sh'art-term. In the long run, they are offset by ultimate major aversive
consequences such as illness, loneliness, and sorrow. In contrast, the
reinforcers for kindness and moderation (analogous to self-control),
though potentially large, are also relatively delayed and incremental.
Seen this way, getting free from short-term worldly reinforcers (i.e.,
spiritual freedom) means only making a switch, coming under control
of the long-term reinforcement for simple, moderate living and for
kindness toward others. We will return to the idea of behaving for the
good of others in chapter 12.

The Challenge of Traditional Thinking
Traditional thinking, based on free will, challenges the behavior­
analytic view of freedom. If all behavior is determined by inheritance
and environmental history, then how can an individual be held
responsible for his or her actions? Wouldn't society fall apart if people
could not be held responsible? Even if determinism were true, per­
haps it should be opposed anyway, because it is a wicked idea that
seems to undermine democracy and lead inevitably to dictatorship.
When all is said and done, doesn't science tell only how we behave?
Doesn't it still remain silent about how we ought to behave? C. S. Lewis
put this especially well in his book Mere Christianity (1960):
There is one thing, and only one, in the whole universe which we
know more about than we could learn from external observation.
That one thing is Man. We do not merely observe men, we are men.
In this case we have, so to speak, inside information; we are in the
know. And because of that, we know that men find themselves under
a moral law, which they did not make, and cannot quite forget
even when they try, and which they know they ought to obey. Notice
the following point. Anyone studying Man from the outside as we
study electricity or cabbages, not knowing our language and con­
sequently not able to get any inside knowledge from us, but merely
observing what we did, would never get the slightest evidence that
we had this moral law. How could he? For his observations would
only show what we did, and the moral law is about what we ought to
do. (p. 33)

1 98

Social Issues

Freedom

Lewis's argument is couched in terms of "in here, out there" dualism
that I criticized in chapters 2 and 3. I dealt with having rules (LeWis
writes of having a moral law) in chapter 8. Still, the challenge stands:
What can science tell us about how we ought to behave?
The remaining chapters in the book deal with such questions. In
chapter 10, we will see how determinism still allows a notion of re­
sponsibility. Chapter 11 looks at how behavioral thinking could help us
to solve social problems without threatening our liberty. Chapter 12
considers how far science can go toward understanding how we ought
to behave. Chapters 13 and 14 take up culture, how it changes, and
how behavioral thinking might extend rather than curtail democracy.

Summary
The only use of the words free and freedom that conflicts with behavioral
thinking is that which implies free will. Other uses have more to do
with feeling free and happy. Social, political, and religious freedom
consist of freedom from coercion, which I have defined here as free­
dom from the threat of punishment. When some of our behavioral
alternatives are punished, we cannot feel free. Even if behavior is
positively reinforced in the short run, if it leads to major punishment
in the long run, the person who falls into such a reinforcement trap
cannot feel free. When our behavior is maintained instead by positive
reinforcement (short- and long-term), and our choices are between
different reinforcers, we feel both free and happy. Even spiritual free­
dom can be understood in behavioral terms, when we see that its
advocates encourage a shift away from short-term personal (worldly)
reinforcement to greater long-term reinforcement entailed in simpli­
city and service to others.
Although most uses of free and freedom can be interpreted beha­
viorally, such interpretation implies change in our views of people,
culture, government, law, education, and other social institutions. Free
will aside, the other types of freedom serve useful social functions.
They point the way to the more basic issue: happiness. Advocates of
social freedom oppose the use of threats and punishment to control
behavior, because people who are coerced are unhappy. Advocates
of spiritual freedom strengthen the effects of long-term reinforce­
ment relations that bring greater happiness in the long run. When a
society arranges positive reinforcement for desirable behavior and
supports long-term reinforcement relations, its citizens are productive
and happy.

Chapter 1 0

Responsibility, Credit,
and Blame

In Beyond Freedom and Dignity, Skinner argued that mentalism not
only interferes with attempts to find scientific explanations of behavior,
but is impractical in the sense that it prevents us from solving social
problems like war, crime, and poverty. One pair of mentalistic terms
that he criticized was credit and blame. Although Skinner discussed
credit and blame in connection with the concept of dignity, in my
experience arguments about the social implications of behaviorism
more often revolve around the related notion of responsibility. People
are considered to have dignity when they can be considered respons­
ible. In this chapter, we will focus on the concept of responsibility, its
philosophical underpinnings, and its practical implications.

Responsibility and the Causes of Behavior
In many uses, the word responsible seems to be a way of talking
about causes. When we say, " Bad wiring was responsible for the fire,"
we could just as well say, " Bad wiring caused the fire." Other factors
might be involved too, but we mean that bad wiring was the crucial
factor.
What do we mean, however, when we say, "Tom was responsible
for the fire"? Putting Tom in the place of bad wiring has two implica­
tions. The first is the practical implication that Tom set the fire; this
is a potentially important connection and might call for some action
on our part. The second is the implication that Tom caused the fire in
much the same way that faulty wiring might cause a fire. We will
return to practical considerations later; first we need to examine the
notion that a person can be a cause.

201

Free Will and the Visibility of Control
The idea that a person can be responsible for an action, in the sense
of causing the action, is based on the notion of free will discussed in
chapter 1 . In the most common way of thinking, the difference between
faulty wiring causing a fire and Tom causing a fire is that Tom chose
freely to set the fire. The bad wiring is attributed to environmental
factors like vibration and weather, whereas Tom's action is attributed
to Tom himself.
Although common sense might seem to say that Tom and faulty
wiring should be treated differently, the distinction between them tends
to vanish under closer scrutiny. The wiring worked fine when it was
first installed. It became faulty over a long time - many winters, many
summers, years of vibration. Finally it gave out and "set" the fire.
. Similarly with Tom, a combination of genetic factors and a history of
environmental events ( his upbringing) led Tom to be "faulty" and to
set the fire. Tom, like the wiring, is only the instrument by which the
fire came to pass.
This view of Tom's action may seem strange because we are accus­
tomed to drawing a line between the behavior of things and people.
The behavior of people seems different from the behavior of things for
two reasons: the alternatives among which a person might choose
seem obvious; and the factors determining the action chosen remain
hidden. Few of us set fire to houses; that Tom could behave just like
the rest of us seems obvious.
But is it so obvious? We sometimes excuse someone's actions by
saying the person "had no choice." Suppose someone was holding
a gun to Tom's head when he set the fire; we might say he had no
choice.
Now we have reached a contradiction. lf Tom had a choice before,
he has a choice now. He could refuse and risk having his head blown
off. Either Tom has a choice both with the gun held to his head and
when he acts on his own or he has no choice in either situation.
Tom is said to have no choice only because the reason for his action
(the gun) is apparent. The more we learn about the reasons for Tom's
setting the fire the less we say he chose freely. Say he was abused as a
child or he is a pyromaniac. We begin to think of him as faulty in
much the same way as the wiring, and we say he couldn't help it.
The temptation to invoke free will arises because we cannot see
anything faulty about Tom, the way we can see that a wire is frayed. If
no cause is clear and present, like a gun aimed at Tom's head, then we
have to look to events in the past. These, however, can be difficult to

Social Issues

discover. Invoking free will is an easy way out, but it is no explanation
at all from a scientific point of view.

credit could be assigned. If, instead, reinforcers for desirable actions
were delivered without one's having to pretend the actions originated
entirely from within, people would feel more free to acknowledge
environmental factors, as Isaac Newton did when he said, " If I have
seen so far, it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants."
Whereas separating punishment from personal blame makes for
compassion, separating reinforcement from personal credit makes
for honesty.

202

Assigning Credit and Blame
When responsibility is bound up with free will and the idea that
people cause their own behavior, then it seems only natural to assign
credit and blame to people for actions of which we approve and dis­
approve. Credit and blame are yet another way of talking about causes,
but with the added element of approval and disapproval.
Creditable actions are reinforced; blameable actions are punished.
We will discuss good and bad actions further in chapter 12, but for the
present discussion we need to note only that people seek credit but
avoid blame.
People make up all sorts of excuses when they are caught in some
shameful act, everything from "The devil made me do it" to "my
unhappy childhood." The point is to assign blame to something else the devil, the unhappy childhood - in other words, to put the causes
for the behavior in the environment. Defense attorneys argue for com­
passion. They persuade judges to consider extenuating circumstances
in the experience of people convicted of all sorts of crimes. From a
behavioral perspective, extenuating circumstances mean environmental
factors, and compassion means considering those environmental factors.
In contrast, when people have credit assigned to them for some
praiseworthy deed, they often resist any suggestion that environmental
factors may have played a role. Successful businesspeople frequently
attribute their achievements to hard work and sacrifice, rarely to luck.
Artists, writers, composers, and scientists often evade or resent ques­
tions about where they get their ideas. No one wants to talk about the
extenuating circumstances of their creditable actions (unless modesty
is reckoned a greater virtue than good deeds).
If we are willing to assign the blame for punishable actions to the
environment, then why resist assigning credit for reinforceable actions
to the environment? The reasons are not far to seek. Assigning blame
to the environment is operant (mostly verbal) behavior. It is reinforced
by avoiding punishment. We get out of sticky situations by blaming
environmental factors. People resist assigning credit to the environ­
ment because that would have an analogous effect, except the loss
would be credit instead of blame. The behavior of assigning credit to
the environment would be punished by the loss of reinforcers. As long
as the practice of linking reinforcement to the assigning of credit con­
tinues, people will tend to conceal the environmental factors to which

Compassion and Control
In the past, the idea that people choose according to free will was
often bound up with the use of punishment to persuade people to
avoid wrong actions. Thieves had their hands cut off; public hangings
were common.
In the United States today such ideas and practices are giving way
to a more compassionate approach to wrongdoing. The notion of
extenuating circumstances introduces the possibility of moving beyond
blaming and punishing criminals. It allows judges more flexibility in
deciding what consequences to apply. A teenager who steals a car to
impress his friends can be treated differently from an adult who steals
cars for a living.
From a practical standpoint, criminal behavior raises two sorts of
questions: (1) Can the behavior be changed? and (2) If so, what must
be done to change it? ( If the answer to the first question is "no," then
the second becomes how to protect the rest of society from an incorri­
gible criminal.) When we focus on how to change behavior, we raise
practical questions, such as whether jailing the miscreant will serve
any useful purpose, whether the person might benefit from job train­
ing, or whether counseling might help. The more we recognize that
behavior is under the control of genes and environmental history, the
more we feel free to be compassionate and practical about correcting
wrongdoers.
Much controversy surrounds giving heinous crimes the death
penalty. Execution cannot reduce the likelihood of the behavior
recurring, because no further behavior will occur. Its supporters usu­
ally consider it a deterrent for other potential miscreants. A few states
have abandoned the death penalty in favor of life imprisonment, but
When they did so, the murder rate showed no change. Thus far, no
evidence supports the idea that the death penalty acts as a deterrent.
As long as no evidence exists, and we might sometimes execute an
innocent person, opposition to the death penalty seems well founded.

204

Social Issues

Counterarguments are possible, however, because a life sentence serves
no function other than to keep that person off the streets and keeping
someone in prison is hugely expensive to the taxpayers. The debate
will continue, but might be considered in more practical terms than
people's misplaced notions of free choosing and retribution.
If it is better to be practical about wrong behavior, it might also
be better to be practical about right behavior. The advantages of prac­
ticality about right behavior have been slower to catch on, mostly
because people retain credit for their correct actions only so long as
the rewards for virtue remain obscure. When we learn that a philan­
thropist gets a break on income taxes, we give that person less credit
for the donation. If people were rewarded for obeying the speed limit
instead of fined for breaking it, those who obeyed would no longer be
able to feel righteous and superior to those who speed.
People who cling to credit often call the use of rewards to strengthen
desirable behavior "bribery," as if there were something ignoble about
doing right for clear reasons. In 1991, Oprah Winfrey had a discussion
on her TV talk show about a highly successful program to prevent
teenage girls from getting pregnant and to encourage them to finish
high school. A private organization was helping girls who had already
been pregnant once by paying them small amounts of money every ' "
week as long as they stayed in school, remained nonpregnant, and
attended special classes on nutrition and child-rearing. Many mem�
bers of the audience objected on grounds such as " I cannot agree with
paying people to do what they should do anyway." Ironically, these
objections arose even though the program was saving US taxpayers a
lot of money. Most teenage mothers never finish high school and need
welfare payments to survive. They often have one baby after another; .
and stay on the welfare roll. The teenagers in the program, however,
who had all been on welfare, were now having no more babies, were
finishing school, and were getting off of welfare. Even if the program
had been using federal funds (it wasn't), it still would have saved
money, because its cost was trivial in comparison to the welfare pay­
ments. Insisting that people should do right for " their own" reasons
(i.e., for hidden reasons) and calling reinforcement "bribery" only blocks
us from using reinforcement to strengthen desirable behavior and save
taxpayers' money.
The audience's reaction shows how much slower people have been
to accept the idea of giving up personal credit in favor of arranged
reinforcement. In deciding whether to punish the girls' undesirable
behavior, these same people would probably have spoken of compas­
sion and extenuating circumstances. When deciding on the appro­
priateness of reinforcing correct behavior, however, the people in the

Responsibility, Credit, and Blame

205

talk show never brought up extenuating circumstances. The program
targeted teenage girls who already had babies, a population known
to be at risk. Even though some women in the audience were single
mothers who might well have brought up environmental factors, still
the girls' likely fate if no action was taken failed to bring about accept­
ance of reinforcement. If decisions about social policy are to be more
practical, we must consider environmental effects in decisions about
reinforcement as well as punishment.

Responsibility and the Consequences
of Behavior
Practically, responsibility comes down to a decision on whether to
apply consequences. People trying to decide whether to punish bad
behavior may talk about justice and morality, but in the end, either
no punisher is given or some punisher is decided upon. As a behavior
analyst, I tend to focus on this final, practical outcome. If my son
breaks a window, my decision whether to punish his action or not
depends not so much on considerations of justice as on what I am
likely to accomplish by punishment. Will I reduce the likelihood of a
repetition, or will I just make him resentful? The situation might be
especially complicated if he has confessed to the misbehavior; do I
punish to prevent a repetition or reinforce to strengthen truth-telling?
If you say that you hold Tom responsible for an action (breaking a
window or saving your life), that tells more about your behavior than
about Tom's. It says that you are likely to apply consequences, to
punish or reinforce Tom's behavior. If you say you believe in free will,
that only tells some more about your tendencies; you are probably
more likely to punish and less likely to reinforce. Your tendency to
behave so, however, might have nothing to do with belief in free will.
The lack of need for believing in free will becomes clear when we
examine the way people use the word responsibility, to which we
now turn.

What Is Responsibility?
The' philosopher Gilbert Ryle argued that deciding whether an act is
responsible resembles deciding whether it is intelligent. As we saw in
chapter 3, no single criterion governs the decision about the intelli­
gence of a particular action; we look for clusters or patterns of activity,

206

Social Issues

into which the particular action fits. Someone makes a brilliant move
in a chess game; was it intelligent or lucky? Someone steals money
from his employer; was it part of a pattern of sleazy and criminal
activity or was it an aberration?
The defense of an action on grounds of temporary insanity carries
two implications. First, it implies that the act was uncharacteristic.
Witnesses are called in to testify that a man who beat his girlfriend
in a fit of rage hasn't a violent bone in his body, is kind to animals
and children, helps elderly people across the street, never even raises
his voice. In the example of Tom setting the fire, we inquire whether
he has always been a good citizen or whether he has engaged in other
antisocial acts. Second, temporary insanity means that punishing the
action would serve no purpose, because if the behavior is unlikely
ever to recur, no need arises to deter it. If setting fires is totally unchar­
acteristic of Tom, then we need have no fear of a repeat offense.
The idea of responsibility shares much with the ideas of intention
and acting "on purpose" discussed in chapter 5. When a particular
action is part of a pattern and the reinforcement for it is obvious, we
are inclined to say it was done on purpose and that the person should
be held responsible for it. In a practical approach to wrongdoing, the
'
reinforcement is the problem. The bank teller is tempted to embezzle
because of the money. Bank managers usually try to deter such behavior
by threatening to punish it and by following through with punish­
ment if it occurs. The threat and the punishment are meant to offset
the temptation and the reinforcement. We hold the person responsible
in the sense that we make the threat and punish the behavior if it
occurs.
Although responsibility is usually talked about in connection with
reprehensible actions, such reasoning can be extended also to credit­
able actions. The question with desirable actions is whether to rein­
force them. If a child does his or her homework regularly, there may
be no need to apply any special reinforcement, but if homework is
completed irregularly and only with reminders, then reinforcing com­
pletion with praise and special treats may be essential. Is this wrong?
Is this bribery? If the behavior is desirable for good reasons (long-term
reinforcers), then special reinforcement should be necessary only to
establish the behavior. Once homework is being completed regularly,
the special reinforcers can be phased out. A policy of this sort would
justify programs like the one of paying welfare mothers to avoid
pregnancy and stay in school; once the woman has graduated and is
supporting herself as we would normally expect, the payments can
stop. (The payments must, of course, be small in comparison with the
reinforcers for being self-supporting.)

Responsibility, Credit, and Blame

207

When a person behaves "responsibly," that person is behaving in
ways that society deems useful. Usually this means behaving in
accordance with long-term reinforcement relations; in the terms of
chapter 9, this use of responsible coincides with self-control ( Bs in
figure 9.2). If Mary saves her money instead of squandering it, she
behaves responsibly. Similarly, if Mary stays in school, in accordance
with long-term reinforcement, instead of dropping out in accordance
with short-term reinforcement, she behaves responsibly.
Responsible behavior needs to be maintained. If long-term reinforce­
ment is insufficient to maintain staying in school ( Bs), and remaining
in school is desirable behavior, then private or public institutions must
provide explicit short-term reinforcers for staying that will offset the
short-term reinforcers for dropping out ( B, in figure 9.2). That is why
paying teenage mothers to stay in school may be both practical and
necessary.
From a behavioral viewpoint, talk about responsibility is talk about
the desirability or usefulness of applying consequences. To say we
hold someone responsible is to say we hope to change the person's
behavior by punishing or reinforcing it. The relations that maintain
it or ought to maintain it are clear, and we wish either to offset or
augment them. To say Tom should not be held responsible is to say
that either he is incorrigible ( possibly insane) or the action will
probably never happen again (it was a lucky or unlucky aberration).
Either way, to punish or reinforce the behavior would be useless.
To say that we hold Tom responsible or that we wish to make
Tom responsible is to say that to punish his undesirable behavior or
reinforce his desirable behavior would be useful. Behavior analysts
usually recommend strengthening desirable behavior with positive
reinforcement.

Practical Considerations: The Need for Control
Freedom-loving people oppose management by coercion, because they
recognize that it makes for unhappiness and rebellion in the long run.
Many people who oppose coercion generalize and claim to oppose
control in whatever form. They base their position on the idea that
people should be allowed to choose freely.
In the behavioral perspective, we never choose freely in the sense
of exercising free will, or choosing without explanation. In chapter 9
We discussed choosing freely in the sense of choosing on the basis of
positive reinforcement, the condition in which people tend to feel free
and happy. Choosing on this basis, however, is still explainable. Since,

208

Social Issues

in the behavioral perspective, all actions are controlled - that is, are
explainable - by genetic inheritance and environmental history, the
question of escaping control cannot arise. The parent or manager
who refuses to control the behavior of children or employees only
leaves the control to others and to accident. Control will occur, but by
other children, other employees, and strangers, with who knows what
results. Parents and managers who refuse to control can be called
irresponsible, in that responsible denotes behaving according to long­
term reinforcement relations. The responsible approach to management
and social problems in general is to plan and design environments in
which people will behave well. This idea raises two big questions
that the remainder of the book addresses: Who will control? How will
control be accomplished?

Applying consequences
Whether or not we like it or recognize it, we are constantly reinforcing
and punishing one another's behavior. Probably most of the time
we remain unaware of the consequences we provide for the behavior
of others. My thoughtless remark may cut you to the quick or buoy
you up, though I know nothing of the effect. Someone in a managerial
position, however - parent, teacher, supervisor, or ruler - has to be
aware of the consequences he or she provides; it is part of the job.
To capture the sense of such deliberate providing of consequences,
we can use the word apply and speak of applying reinforcers and
punishers.
Applying consequences - one part of management - is itself operant
behavior, and is under the control of long-term reinforcement rela­
tions. Adequate parenting determines the success of children in adult­
hood. A skilled parent reads the signs of a child's ultimate success
- school performance, friends, athletics - and behaves so as to produce
them. In the same way, adequate supervision determines the profit­
ability of a business. A skilled manager's behavior is under the control
of signs that predict ultimate success - conditional reinforcers like
attendance records, quality-control reports, and sales.
Many of the reinforcers and punishers that control the manager's
behavior (attendance, school grades, and so on) come from those who
are being managed. This fact should be of significance to freedom­
lovers, because it opens the door to recognizing and explicitly engin­
eering mutual control not only in management, but in all human
relationships. We will take up mutual control in chapter 11. For now,
we turn to the question of how to control.

Responsibility, Credit, and Blame

209

What kind of control ?
We saw in chapter 9 that behavior analysts advocate using positive
reinforcement rather than aversive means. When behavior is controlled
by punishment and threats, people report feeling trapped, miserable,
and resentful, and are likely to complain, avoid, and rebel. Coercion is
a poor means of control because it usually backfires in the long run.
Although it can be effective in the short run, sooner or later its accom­
plishments are outweighed by its nasty side effects.
When behavior is under the control of appropriate positive rein­
forcement, people report feeling free, happy, and dignified. They feel
free because they are not punished for their choices, happy because
their choices result in good things, and dignified because the reinforcers
count to their credit. Something important, however, is implied by
saying appropriate positive reinforcement.
Management by positive reinforcement can backfire just as surely as
coercion. When it does, the failure usually happens for two reasons:
behavior-reinforcer mismatch and neglect of history. We discussed
the idea of mismatch briefly in chapter 4, when we noted that rein­
forcers often induce certain sorts of behavior and are also particularly
effective at reinforcing those actions. Pigeons' key-pecking is a good
example; pigeons tend to peck, especially at shiny objects, in situ­
ations where they are likely to be fed, and if pecks at a back-lit key
are reinforced with food, key-pecking becomes established extremely
rapidly. Similarly, when a child interacts with a parent, the parent's
displays of affection (touching, smiling, praise) become powerful
reinforcers that readily strengthen the child's behavior that produces
them. Other reinforcers, like money and goods, may work, but not as
well; without the affection, they may ultimately fail. Unless parents,
teachers, and other caretakers back up token reinforcers (points
exchangeable for goods and privileges awarded to reinforce desired
behaVior) with affection, their management is likely to fail.
For adults, an important factor in management is affiliation. Workers
appear to function better when they belong to moderate-sized groups
with stable membership. Over time, repeated interaction with the same
people tends to make those people a powerful source of social rein­
forcement. The Japanese have long used the power of group affiliation
in their industrial management, and US industry has followed suit,
supp lementing or replacing the isolation of the assembly line with
"quality circles," groups that work as a unit to produce a product from
beginning to end. For adults as well as children, monetary reinforcers
work best if backed up by social reinforcers.

211

Social Issues

Responsibility, Credit, and Blame

The second reason for failure, neglect of history, may be understood
by analogy to momentum. Trying to change behavior that has been
shaped by a long history of powerful reinforcement by superimposing
some new artificial relation may be like hoping to divert a speeding
bus by hitting it with a rubber ball. Part of the skill of an effective
therapist is recognizing old and powerful reinforcement relations.
This is a point about which psychoanalysts are right: To understand
the behavior of an adult, you must often look to the events of child­
hood. For example, if a woman behaves inappropriately with men.
a skilled behavior therapist tries to find out whether her father was
affectionate, what sort of behavior he reinforced with affection, and
what sort of behavior her mother displayed toward her father. The
best way to prevent embezzlement is to provide a history of reinforce­
ment for the behavior we call "respect for the property of others,"
or behavior incompatible with stealing. A bank teller who embezzles
money most likely lacks such a history, and the bank ma.nager who
hopes to prevent a recurrence by threats or ininor incentives would
do better to remove the person from temptation. Interventions that
ignore the history of reinforcement for present behavior are likely
to fail.
Positive reinforcement can be the most powerful means to change
behavior, but it has to be applied correctly. Naive enthusiasm cannot
substitute for an understanding of induction, reinforcement, rules, and
delayed consequences. Without understanding, positive reinforcement,
like any technique, can go wrong in any number of ways and can even
be abused. We will see how behavior analysts approach the problem
of correct and equitable management in chapter 11.

From a practical point of view, creditable actions are ones that the
community reinforces; blameable actions are ones that the community
punishes. Blameable actions are often attributed to genetic and envir­
onmental factors - extenuating circumstances - and treated with com­
pa ssion, whereas creditable deeds are usually attributed to the person.
People try to take credit for their actions to insure that they will be
reinforced. Recognizing the effects of environment on praiseworthy
actions makes for honesty. If we can be practical and compassionate
about punishing undesirable behavior, we can be practical and honest
about reinforcing desirable behavior. Whether someone is responsible
or not in a practical sense comes down to a decision about whether
or not to apply consequences. A plea of temporary insanity or aberra­
tion implies that no practical good can come of punishment. Calling
an action "lucky" implies no use in reinforcement. Parents, teachers,
supervisors, and rulers would manage behavior more effectively if
they made decisions about reinforcement and punishment openly. They
. would manage most effectively if they fostered desirable behavior
with positive reinforcers. Control by threats and punishment can
work in the short run, but makes for rebellion and disaffection in the
long run.
Management by positive reinforcement, however, requires care
and skill. Failures arise when reinforcement is inappropriate and
history is neglected. Appropriate reinforcement for management in
our species is at least partly social. Money and other token reinforcers
appear to be most effective when backed up with reinforcement by
approval and affection from significant others. Neglect of history
results in failure when an assumed normal history is actually absent.
A deficient or abnormal history of reinforcement can overwhelm even
the best management reinforcement relations. Correcting the effects
of a long history requires therapy; until they are corrected, a manager
does well to avoid contexts in which history is likely to produce bad
behavior.

210

Summary
The word responsible is often used to talk about causes, as when we
say that an earthquake was responsible for damage. When applied to
people, this usage raises all the problems of free will because the
people are seen as the origin or cause of their behavior. People are
viewed as the causes of their own behavior when their choices seem
obvious and environmental causes remain obscure. When environ­
mental factors are clear, the person is often said to have no choice. As
genetic and environmental determinants are understood, talk about
free will and responsibility tends to give way to talk about extenuat­
ing circumstances.

Relationships, Management,
and Government

Human beings are highly social creatures. Much of our stimulation,
reinforcement, and punishment comes from one another. The give­
and-take of stimuli and consequences leads us to form relationships
with one another. We take it for granted that a normal person has
relationships with parents, siblings, other relatives, spouse, friends,
and neighbors. Such personal relationships are characteristic of our
species, and can also be found in other species. The special relation­
ships that we call management and government originated more
recently, and we associate them exclusively with human culture. In
this chapter, we will examine the way that behavior analysts can treat
relationships in general, with a special eye to management and gov­
ernment. Critics of behaviorism have often claimed that it will lead
to inhumane management and totalitarian government. This chapter
shows why these accusations are false.

Relationships
When do we say two individuals have a relationship? Isolated
encounters widely separated in time cannot suffice. If the mail carrier
and I say hello to each other once a month, we can hardly be said to
have a relationship, although if we greeted one another on a daily
basis, the claim might have some basis. Though the frequency of inter­
action required for saying two people have a relationship varies from
speaker to speaker, the higher the frequency, the more likely is this
Sort of verbal behavior.
If a relationship consists of frequent repeated interaction, we still
need to say what we mean by interaction. Figures 7.1 and 9.1 diagram

two types of interaction: a verbal episode and a coercive episode. Such
episodes might never repeat: I might ask the time of someone I never
see again, and I might deliver my wallet to a robber I never meet
again. When such episodes occur over and over, however, then the
two individuals have a relationship. To understand what interaction
means in behavioral terms, we must understand a feature that verbal
episodes, coercive episodes, and other interactions have in common:
mutual reinforcement.

it likely that the responder will act (work, smile, give a gift) s o that Bo
is reinforced (S�). This reinforcer functions also as a discriminative
stimulus (S82) for further behavior on the part of the initiator ( B02)
that provides reinforcers (S�) for the responder's behavior (BR)·
At the point where both parties have acted and their actions have
reinforced, the episode could end. That could be called the
een
b
minimal social episode.
The episode could continue, however, as when two people have a
conversation. In figure 11.1, when the initiator responds to the stimulus
(5 82) provided by the responder'S behavior, one could say they have
switched roles. The roles could switch again. This possibility is indic­
ated in figure 11.1 by the notation in brackets showing that S� could
serve as a discriminative stimulus (st) for further behavior (Bd· The
roles could continue to switch back and forth until there was some
sort of a break. Sometimes an interaction may seem interminable for
one of the parties, as when the responder is polite and the initiator is
a persistent salesperson or a religious fanatic.
Let us consider a couple of examples. Zack works for a wholesaler
that distributes lenses to opticians, and Naomi is his supervisor. One
interaction they have is occasioned by the arrival of a number of
orders in the mail (S8). Naomi hands Zack a stack of orders to fill ( Bo)·
The stack of orders sets the context (S�) for Zack to get busy searching
through thousands of drawers for the correct lenses (BR)· The sight of
Zack at work reinforces (S�) Naomi's original behavior (giving him
the orders) and serves also as a discriminative stimulus (S82) for her to
say something like "Way to go" (or perhaps only to withhold criticism;
either would constitute B02), which serves to reinforce (S�) Zack's
working. At the end of the week, of course, in another interaction,
Naomi's "Way to go" is backed up with a paycheck.
For a second example, we have a married couple, Nick and Shona.
Weekday mornings, Shona gets all ready to leave for work at 7:30 (5 8).
She stands with her briefcase at the door and says, Well, I'm off (Bo),
which produces the sound "Well, I'm off" that Nick hears (S�), and
which occasions his ( BR) saying Have a good day, I'll see tonight and
kissing her. Nick's affectionate behavior serves to reinforce (S�) Shona's
original announcement and also sets the context (S82) for her to
respond with something like You have a good day, too (B02)' Nick's
hearing Shona's affectionate reply reinforces (S�) his affectionate
behavior.
When such social episodes occur repeatedly between the same two
individuals, we say that they have a relationship. In certain limited
relationships, the actions and reinforcers might always be the same. If

214

Mutual Reinforcement
We call verbal episodes and coercive episodes social because each
person's behavior reinforces the other's. When one person watches
another - a detective in a police investigation or a peeping Tom nothing social occurs, because reinforcement goes only one way. Stage
performances usually cannot be called social; they only become social
when the performer's behavior is reinforced by the audience. For an
episode to be called a social interaction and to count as the basis for a
relationship, reinforcement must be mutual.
Figure 11.1 shows a general diagram of a social interaction. As in
the earlier diagrams, a colon indicates stimulus control, and an arrow
connects a consequence to the behavior that produces it. One person
opens the episode with some operant behavior Bo under the control
of the setting, S8, which includes the other person, the responder.
Bo could be stating a rule (making a threat or a promise such as If
you don 't work I will beat you or If you work I will pay you), smiling, or
offering a gift. This produces a discriminative stimulus (S�), making

Relationships, Management, and Government

Gideon buys the newspaper from the same news dealer every morning,
one might say Gideon and the dealer have a relationship. In other
relationships, the actions and reinforcers vary widely. A husband and
wife may cook for one another, shop together, discuss their children,
make love. All of these can be diagrammed as in figure 11.1, but the
actions and reinforcers differ from one interaction to another.
We distinguish relationships between peers from relationships
between unequals. Two brothers or two friends may be peers, but
an employer and employee or my cat and me would be considered
unequals. Two people can be called peers when their interactions
include actions and reinforcers on both sides that are similar in kind.
If two brothers are affectionate with one another, ask and receive money
of one another, and lend toys and tools to one another, then we say
they are peers. We might deny the brothers were peers if one is affec­
tionate and the other is not or one always borrows money from the
other but never the other way around.
In relationships between unequals little or no overlap exists betWeen
the actions and reinforcers on the two sides. Naomi, the employer,
gives work, pays wages, and receives part of the profits from the sales;
Zack, the employee, works and receives wages. The patient presents
symptoms and pays fees; the physician gives advice and treatment�

and doctors will be on duty.
One can talk about relationships to organizations because, regard­
less of the particular people playing the organizational roles, the rein­
forcement relations involved remain the same. In a sense this is true
by definition: We speak of a group as an organization because it has a
certain stability. It is not the personnel who are stable, because people
come and go. Neither do buildings make an organization what it is; a
hospital may move to a new building and still be known as the same
hospital. If the hospital is taken over by new owners, however, it may
become a different hospital even if it is in the same building. What
remains stable is the mode of operating - in our terms, the reinforce­
ment and punishment relations.
In a sense, the activities of an organization parallel the extended
activities of an individual person, because the activities of the mem­
bers of an organization are parts that must function together for the
organization to function successfully, just as the various activities of
an individual person must function together as parts for the extended
activity to be successful. Baking a cake requires adding the ingredi­
ents, mixing, pouring into a pan, and cooking in the oven to produce
a successful cake. In the same way, the functioning of a bank requires
the activities of tellers, loan officers, salespeople, clerks, supervisors,
guards, and janitors to operate successfully. The difference, of course,
is that in the one person's extended activity, all the parts are activities
of the same person, whereas in the organization all the parts are activ­
ities of different people. As with the one person's extended activity,
however, reinforcement of the whole (the success of the organization)
provides reinforcement for all the parts. In any relationship, including
those within an organization, mutual reinforcement is key; all parties
must benefit from the functioning of the whole if the relationship or
organization is to be successful.
As in a relationship between two people, a relationship between
a person and an organization includes two sets of reinforcement
relations: those that affect the person's behavior, and those that affect
the behavior of the organization. In the terms of figure 11.1, the person
or the organization could be either the initiator or the responder. If
a bank sends you an invitation to apply for a loan, the bank is the
initiator. However, if you go to a bank uninvited and apply for a loan,
you are the initiator. You make out your application ( Bo), which pro­
vides the stimulus (S�) for the bank to make its decision (BR) to offer
you a loan, reinforcing your behavior (S�). Now you respond by
signing the loan agreement ( B02), which reinforces the bank's granting
of the loan. You and the bank will now have an ongoing relationship

Individuals and Organizations
The conception embodied in figure 11.1 can be applied not only to
relationships between individuals, but also to relationships between
individuals and organizations. It can even apply to relationships
between organizations. To do this, we may treat the organization as
if it were an individual. That creates no confusion as long as we
remember that organizations are, after all, composed of individual
people. A company, church, or government is a group of persons, all
of whom have relationships with some others of the group. Saying
that everyone in a company has a relationship with everyone else
might be an overstatement, but being part of the organization entails
having relationships with, for example, superiors and subordinates.
Treating organizations as if they were individuals makes sense
because organizational functionaries are replaceable. Judges, ministers,
doctors, and nurses leave and are replaced by new players who serve
the same functions. In larger organizations, members are even inter­
changeable, at different times switching roles. When you call the
Internal Revenue Service or are admitted to the hospital, you usually

because you and the bank will have monthly interactions in which the
bank will request a payment, you will pay, and the bank will send a
receipt.
Some behavior analysts have applied this general framework to
thinking about international relations, considering interactions between
governments as analogous to interactions between people. Arms races,
for example, can be understood this way (Nevin, 1985). When one
country arms itself, it presents a threat (S�) to the other. The other
responds by threatening back. The first responds in kind, and so on.
Political scientists refer to this tendency as the security dilemma. In
a seminal paper about the origins of World War I, Van Evera (1984)
described the arms buildup prior to the war as an oscillation of
ascendancy between opposing governments. Now one would increase
its offensive capabilities, now the other, and each time ascendancy
would switch sides, because the government trying to make itself
secure would go beyond parity. The period of ascendancy created a
window of opportunity within which the stronger party was tempted
to attack while it had the advantage. One such window of opportun­
ity, Van Evera explained, finally triggered the .war.
Each action in such an oscillating relationship makes sense (is
reinforced) in the short run, but the long-term consequences are
disastrous. The situation may be seen as a problem in self-control
(figure 9.2), because alternatives to such races, such as signing treaties
and cooperation, pay off better in the long run, but may be difficult
to establish because they are risky in the short run. In the terms of
chapter 8, the absence of rule-giving, such as campaigning for peace,
virtually guarantees that short-term relations, such as gaining an
advantage by striking first, will prevail over long-term relations, such
as the greater benefits of peace in the long run.

reinforced. I gain the cloth (S�), and the merchant gains the money
(S�). We say the merchant cheated me because, in a larger context, we
see an inequity between the two reinforcers; the merchant's pay-off is
too large relative to my pay-off. This larger context sets the fair price.
I may never learn that I was cheated, but if I look in other shops or
talk to people who know prices, I may conclude that I was cheated
(these discriminative stimuli change my verbal behavior).
In a subtler form of cheating, the two parties have an ongoing rela­
tionship, and the one being cheated fails to come into contact with the
larger context that would expose the inequity of reinforcement. This
larger context would usually develop over a long time. For example,
one person might make promises but fail to keep them or more likely
keep only some of them and then make more promises. We say the
promiser "strings along" the other person. Eventually the person being
cheated may catch on - the person's verbal and nonverbal behavior
may shift dramatically - because the situation goes on long enough
and may be compared with alternative courses of action (other jobs,
divorce, rebellion). Governments sometimes take steps to protect
citizens from long-term cheating, particularly when they might learn
that they have been cheated too late to remedy the situation. Child­
labor laws, for example, prevent children from entering into relation­
ships with employers that would pay off in the short run but, by
depriving them of opportunities to play and learn, would cheat them
in the long run. A relationship of this sort, with short-term positive
reinforcement but long-term cheating, is called exploitation.

Exploitation
In our discussion of coercion (chapters 9 and 10), we saw that social
interactions need not serve the interests of both parties, even though
both parties' behavior is reinforced. When a robber demands money
and gets it, only the robber benefits, because handing over the money
is negatively reinforced; the victim "benefits" only by avoiding injury.
Another sort of interaction prompts talk of cheating. Suppose I go
into a shop to buy some cloth, and the merchant charges me twice
the going rate. Looking at such an interaction in terms of figure 11.1,
we have to agree that the actions of both parties were positively

219

The "Happy Slave"
The possibility of coercion - out-and-out slavery - may pose less of a
threat to democracy than the possibility of the happy slave. Coercion
is immediately apparent to the person coerced, whereas the happy
slave is content in the short run and may discover the exploitation
only after a long time. Being content, because their behavior is posit­
ively reinforced, happy slaves take no action to correct their situation.
Children working in factories in the nineteenth century were paid and
often received care; they were mostly content. Only in middle age
would they realize how they had been cheated, if they were to realize
it at all. Whatever action they could take then would come too late to
prevent harm.
Happy slaves can occur in many different kinds of relationships.
Parents can exploit children, rewarding them with care and affection
for working, begging in the street, or sexual acts. A husband may

Social Issues

Relationships, Management, and Government

exploit his wife by reinforcing her service to him and his children
with affection and gifts; a wife may exploit a husband by reinforcing
long hours of hard work in the same way. An employer may exploit
employees by offering them extra pay for working in hazardous or
unhealthy conditions. A government may exploit its citizens by rein­
forcing gambling in a lottery. One nation may exploit another by taking
raw materials in exchange for goods manufactured from those same
raw materials. In each of these examples, the one who is exploited
may remain content for a long while or even indefinitely.

In the terms of chapter 9, figure 11.2 illustrates that an exploitive
relationship constitutes a reinforcement trap. (See figure 9.2.) The
target behavior BR corresponds to acting impulsively in accordance
with the short-term reinforcement. Self-controt acting in accordance
with the long-term punishment, would mean acting so as to stay out
of the exploitive relationship or to change a relationship so that it is no
longer exploitive. Figure 11.2 represents just the sort of reinforcement
relation that is pointed to by rules (chapter 8) whereby parents and
other caretakers warn their charges against impulsive behavior and
reinforce behavior that prevents exploitation.
The trouble with happy-slave relationships in behavior management
is that they are unstable. The exploited party may wake up to the loss,
and the results then resemble those of coercion. The once-happy slave
now becomes angry, resentfut and rebellious. The exploited child who
has lost in health, education, or ability to enter into normal relation­
ships may now reject the parents. The exploited spouse who has never
- pursued personal interests may now leave the marriage. Employees
who have been exploited eventually punish their employers. Citizens
and colonies rebel. As with coercion, in the long run exploitation
backfires.
It appears that equity is the only stable policy. Here, however, two
age-old questions arise: What is equity? How do we achieve it? Behavior
analysis allows us to frame these questions in a way that leads to relat­
ively clear answers. The first question can be understood as a question
about verbal behavior, and we will discuss it now. The question of
how to achieve equity will corne up when we discuss counter-control.

220

Long-Term Consequences
From the standpoint of the exploited party, the trouble with exploita­
tion is that it entails long-term punishment. Figure 11.2 is a modified
version of figure 1 1 .1 showing such punishment. The target behavior
BR results in two sorts of consequences, the more immediate S� and
the delayed punisher S�. The long arrow indicates its long-term
nature. S� is written large to emphasize the key factor that inclines us
to call the relationship exploitive - that the long-term punishment
outweighs the short-term reinforcement.
Figure 11.2 omits another cornman feature of exploitation. The
punisher S� usually grows incrementally as the relationship continues.
If a child works for a summer, little loss results, and the experience
might even be called beneficial. But if a child works for all the years of
childhood, the results are considered disastrous. Each year of work
digs the hole deeper, so to speak. That the punishment is both delayed
and incremental makes the relation particularly difficult for the
exploited person to detect.

Comparative Well- Being
When do people speak of equity and inequity? These words are notori­
ously difficult to define. Notions of equity vary from person to person:
Shona might say making convicts work in road gangs is right; Gideon
may regard it as shameful exploitation. Notions of equity within a
culture vary from century to century: In the early days of the Indus­
trial Revolution, most people accepted the idea that capitalists should
make as much profit as they could and workers should work as hard
as they were willing to. As time went on, enough people began to call
the situation inequitable that reforms occurred; trade unions, welfare
legislation, and socialism arose.
Behavior analysts approach variation in verbal behavior, whether
from person to person or from time to time, by looking at the con­
sequences and context of the behavior. If Shona says that road gangs

222

Social Issues

Relationships, Management, and Government

are equitable, she is making a discrimination that Gideon does not
make. Let us say she regards prisoners as an expensive liability,
draining the taxpayers' money. That is, her verbal behavior about
convicts, jails, taxpayers' money, and debts to society has been shaped
by a history of reinforcement different from Gideon's; no doubt
they travel in different circles, different verbal communities. Perhaps
Gideon's parents reinforced talk of equality under the law or in the
eyes of God.
The discriminative stimulus for calling a situation exploitive or
inequitable is a comparison of consequences. The consequences to
one person or group are compared with the consequences to another.
For instance, is it equitable for women to be paid less than men for the
same work? In the United States and other western nations, children
learn from an early age to make such comparisons between them­
selves and others. The utterance She got more than me is likely to be
reinforced with more ice cream, toys, or whatever is being compared.
It's not fair becomes a refrain in some houses because it is frequently
reinforced, with sympathy if not with goods.
As we move into adulthood, our discussions about what is fair
become more complicated. The discriminative stimuli controlling ver­
bal behavior about equity become more complex. We learn that some:: '
times it is fair for one person to receive more than another, especially
if one person contributes more effort than the other. Perhaps high­
steel construction workers should be paid more than carpenters, if one
considers the hazards of high-steel construction.

equal the man's. In our supervisor-employee example, however, if
Naomi the supervisor invests more than Zack the employee, then their
profit/ investment ratios can be equal only if she profits more from
their relationship than Zack. (She also profits more from her relation­
ship with the company than Zack does.) To determine whether equity
exists between two parties, one cannot look at profit or investment
alone; one must look at the ratio between the two.
Equity theory conceives of profit to include relatively short-term
consequences, such as effort and wages. Profit consists of the party's
net gain from the relationship, or gain minus cost (e.g., wages minus
effort). When Zack exerts himself to fill orders, the company must
reinforce his order-filling adequately with money for his behavior to
continue. In other sorts of relationships, the gains are less tangible. If
Nick is to wash the dishes regularly, Shona must make sure that he
profits from his efforts enough to keep him at it. According to equity
theory, Nick's profit from the marriage would be reckoned by sub­
tracting efforts like dish-washing from gains like affection and oppor­
tunities to reproduce.
Homans's concept of investment includes two components: (1)
efforts like getting an education, which are investments in the sense
that they are supposed to pay off in long-term reinforcers and (2)
personal attributes like good looks or gender that might be helpful in
social interactions but are investments in no ordinary sense of the word.
The first type is uncontroversial; to consider education and experience
when setting wages is accepted practice. In terms of equity theory, if
the only difference between Stacy and Marcia is that Stacy is a college
graduate and Marcia only finished high school, Stacy's profit/invest­
ment ratio equals Marcia's only if Stacy is paid more. Presumably,
Stacy and Marcia would agree that this was equitable.
The second type of investment raises more controversy. Is it right
that, other things being equal, males should be paid more than females
for the same work? Regardless of whether it is right, such disparities
in pay do occur. Equity theory says nothing about the way people
ought to behave; it addresses the way they do behave. Someone
who has been brought up to think that males should be paid more
than females or that whites should be paid more than blacks sees no
inequity in males and whites being paid more. These attributes are
investments in that logically they belong in the denominator of the
profit/ investment ratio: a man who thinks he should be paid more
than a woman requires a larger profit before he will say that he is paid
equitably relative to the woman. A similar phenomenon occurs in the
realm of personal relationships when good-looking people require more
profit from relationships than their less good-looking counterparts.

Equity theory
In discussing equity, organizational psychologists and social psycho­
logists refer to a ratio that compares relatively immediate reinforcers
(called outcome or profit) with longer-term conditions (called input or
investment). In the classic statement of equity theory by George Homans
(1961), the ratio is written this way: profit/investments.
Homans argued that decisions about equity depend on this ratio. If
two people in a relationship have equal profit/investment ratios, the
relationship is equitable. If two people or groups have unequal profit/
investment ratios in their relationships with a third party (Acme Lens
Company or the United States government), then the disparity between
them is inequitable.
The profit/investment ratio can increase in two ways: investment
can decrease or profit can increase. If a woman and a man invest
equally in a job, then equity demands that the woman's pay (profit)

223

225

Social Issues

Relationships, Management, and Government

Good looks may be called an investment in the same manner of
speaking in which people are said to capitalize on their good looks. A
beautiful woman may demand expensive jewelry, saying ''I'm worth
it"; a handsome man may demand to have sex sooner than his partner
feels ready for it and see nothing unfair in it.
The mentalistic view of investments appeals to something inside the
person, such as an expectation about reinforcement in various set­
tings. The person is said to demand more profit because of the expecta­
tion. To the behavior analyst, such an account explains nothing. One
might ask what an expectation is and where it comes from.
From the behavior-analytic perspective, the elements of equity theory
- gain, cost, and investment - all constitute discriminative stimuli that
govern verbal behavior about equity. The usefulness of equity theory
is that it points to the various factors that lead to calling a comparison
equitable or inequitable. If one party in a relationship receives more
pay or other reinforcers than the other party, that is weighed agCiinst
any difference in immediate costs (e.g., effort expended), differences
in experience and education, and differences in personal attributes
(e.g., gender, race, and looks). The profit/investment ratio cannot
be taken as a mathematical quantity, because no one knows how to
calculate profit or investment from all the different factors that enter
into them, but it does illustrate that various conflicting comparisons
all combine to affect the likelihood of words like equitable and inequit­
able, fair and unfair. Zack may call it fair that his supervisor Naomi
is paid more than he is, considering her greater experience, but if
Naomi were a man and Zack's training was that men are paid more
than women, he might accept a larger disparity in pay and still call it
equitable.

parents or other authority figures might have taught him this, shaping
his verbal behavior about males, females, and fairness. Either way,
Zack's history with factors such as gender, race, education, and looks
affects which disparities he calls fair and which he calls unfair.
When he falls in love with Stacy, who ardently supports women's
rights, Zack's judgments about equity change. As Stacy reinforces and
punishes his verbal and non-verbal behavior around women, his " con­
sciousness gets raised" and he no longer says that lower pay for women
is equitable.
Often shifts in how factors are weighed translate into shifts in which
group is held up for comparison. In the nineteenth century, child labor
may have seemed equitable because starving peasant children were
held up for comparison. In the twentieth century, when the social
costs of child labor became apparent, middle-class children who played
and attended school were held up for comparison and verbal behavior
about child labor switched accordingly. Laborers taught to compare
themselves only to other laborers see no inequity if bureaucrats enjoy
special privileges; other laborers without such training might compare
their plight with that of the bureaucracy and declare inequity. When
enough such comparisons are made, we get events like the break-up
of the Soviet Union ( Lamal, 1991).

224

Which comparisons ?
This last example illustrates a strength of behavior analysis. Equity
theory only points out the various factors that enter into equity-talk
and takes for granted which factors are weighed. Behavior analysis
goes a step beyond to ask what determines which factors will be
weighed.
The answer to that question lies in the person's history. Every
discrimination depends on past reinforcement and punishment, and
calling some disparities equitable and others inequitable should be no
exception. Zack might come to view higher wages to men as equitable
in two ways. First, his experience in jobs he has had might actually
be that women are paid less than men for the same work. Second, his

Cooperation
Our concepts of equitable and mutual reinforcement allow us to
understand cooperation. A cooperative relationship is one in which
reinforcement is both mutual and equitable. Sometimes cooperation
occurs in the short term, when both parties must contribute imme­
diately before either one's behavior can be reinforced. For example, if
an orchestra is performing a symphony, each member must play a
part before the whole performance can be approved by the audience
and paid for by the sponsors. Everyone plays a part and everyone
benefits together. Often, however, cooperation occurs in the long term
only, when the different parties' contributions are made at different
times. This happens when people reciprocate, as when a husband and
wife take turns doing housework or friends treat one another to drinks
and meals. Reciprocal relationships open the possibility of cheating,
if one party fails to contribute sufficiently (i.e., fails to deliver S� in
figure 11.2 sufficiently often). As long as the reciprocity works out to
be equitable in the long run, however, the relationship constitutes
cooperation. We will discuss such relationships further when we take
up altruism in chapter 12.

226

Social Issues

Control and Counter-Control
Declarations of inequity occasioned by coercive and exploitive rela­
tionships spur revolution as a means to more just arrangements. Over­
throwing a government, a marriage, or a business constitutes extreme
action. A revolution, a divorce, or a strike seems like the last resort,
undertaken only when other means have failed.
The extreme measures change the exploited person's (controllee's)
situation by severing the relationship; lesser means, such as threats
and promises, make changes within the relationship by changing the
behavior of the exploiter (controller). The threat of revolution, divorce,
or strike may serve to coerce the offending party into change. Such
control exerted back toward the controller adds a new relation, which
can be represented in the general terms of figure 11.1. Behavior analysts
call this counter-control.

Counter-Control
Counter-control of the coercive sort may be compared to figure 9.1.
The downtrodden person or group threatens the removal of reinforcers
- goods or services - unless the controller complies. Examples need
not be so extreme as threats of revolution and divorce; the threats
could be of sabotage or disaffection. No matter how asymmetrical the
relationship, as long as the controller wants something from the con­
trollee - as long as the controller's behavior can be reinforced by the
controllee - the controllee can threaten to withhold. When the threat is
effective, the controller's behavior is counter-controlled by negative
reinforcement.
Counter-control can also occur by positive reinforcement. Many
relationships allow threats to be replaced by promises. Employees
may promise higher productivity if their wages are raised. A wife
may promise to contribute money to the household if her husband
will help her pursue a career. If the controller's behavior changes, it is
positively reinforced. The reinforcement may only occur long term,
but the controller will eventually be better off.
Counter-control implies that the controller has choice, that alternat­
ive action is available. Since the choice is between an alternative that
pays off only in the short run and an alternative that pays off better in
the long run, the controller's situation may be compared to figure 9.2;
it is a problem in self-control. The controllee produces a discriminative
stimulus that changes the likelihood of the alternative that pays off

Relationships, Management, and Government

227

better in the long run. When their subjects threaten rebellion, rulers
may lower taxes instead of raising them. When employees promise
the factory owner an increase in product quality, the owner may
switch to the new management scheme the employees suggest. Since
the threats or promises by the controllee constitute rules, and may
be backed up by short-term reinforcement, the situation may be
compared to figure 8.2, which diagrammed rule-governed behavior.
Thus, the controller's choosing the better long-term relationship cor­
responds both to self-control (figure 9.2) and rule-governed behavior
(figure 8.2).
Figure 11.3 diagrams the two types of counter-control we have
discussed. In each diagram, the interactions on the left show counter­
control. The controller can act in either of two ways, equitably ( Bo;
lower taxes and cancel the war) or exploitively ( Bx; raise taxes and
pursue the war). Each of the two alternatives leads to a different rela. tionship between the parties, symbolized by the boxes on the right.
The relationship to which activity Bx leads, in the lower box, may be
the present state of affairs; Bx would keep "business as usual." Activity
Bo, however, would lead to a new relationship (upper box) that would
be more beneficial to both controller and controllee. The controllee
promises or threatens ( Bc), producing a discriminative stimulus, sg
(" Increase our wages or we'll strike!" - a rule, as in chapter 8), that
points to the upper box (relationship) with its set of reinforcement
relations and promotes the controller's alternative Bo (e.g., increasing
wages). When the controllee counter-controls by threat (top diagram),
sg points to the superiority of Bo on the basis that Bx leads ultimately
to major aversive consequences (S�) to the controller. These result
from the behavior of the controllee (Bd in response to S�, the long­
term aversive consequences to the controllee. If rulers overtax their
subjects, the subjects will rebel and depose the rulers.
When the controllee counter-controls by promise (bottom diagram
in figure 11 .3), sg points to the superiority of Bo on the basis that
it leads ultimately to major reinforcers for both parties (S� and S�).
When the subjects enjoy peace and prosperity, they adore and
applaud their rulers. Action on the part of the controllee ( BR3) may
or may not be necessary; a combination of profit-sharing and improved
quality control may be directly beneficial to both employer and
employees.
Controllees often combine the two types of counter-control, offering
both a threat and a promise. Citizens' groups threaten to turn officials
out of office if they adopt one policy while simultaneously promising
support if they adopt another. This strategy is often called the "the
carrot and the stick" technique.

Figure 1 1 .3:

Counter-control. In both counter-control by threat (top
diagram) and counter-control by promise (bottom diagram), the
controller chooses between two relationships with the controllee,
shown in the boxes to the right. Action Bo on the controller's part
leads to a better long-term relationship. Action Bx leads to or continues
a less favorable relationship. Counter-control by threat occurs when
the controllee generates a discriminative stimulus (sg) that points to
a long-term major punisher (S�) for the controller's engaging in Bx.
Counter-control by promise occurs when sg points to long-term
reinforcers (S�) for Bo. Counter-control is necessary when small
immediate consequences (S�, S�, and S�l) tend to outweigh the long­
term consequences (S� or S�). The controllee may be able to supply
some short-term reinforcers for Bo (S�) that help to offset the
short-term consequences favoring Bx .

229

The need for counter-control arises because the controller's choice
between Bo and Bx is a difficult one, for two reasons. First, of the short­
term reinforcers, S�l is bigger than S�l. Moreover, as in figure 9.2,
some immediate punisher (S�; e.g., losing face) may result from choos­
ing Bo and some immediate reinforcer (S�; e.g., winning against an
opponent) for choosing Bx. The immediate and short-term consequences
all favor choosing the exploitive relationship. Second, even though the
major consequences, S� and S�, outweigh the short-term difference in
reinforcement, they are deferred. The controller might have to wait
a long time before reaping the advantages of Bo. That is what makes
the choice between Bo and Bx, without counter-control, a reinforce­
ment trap (figure 9.2). Without counter-control, the controller is likely
to behave impulsively, choosing Bx. The controllee's rule-giving, how­
ever, backed up with immediate reinforcers (S� in figure 11.3; e.g.,
approval and congratulations) offsetting the immediate consequences
favoring Bx, helps to promote the alternative that is better in the long
run (see figure 8.2).

Equity
Counter-control arises from considerations of equity. If the discrim­
inative stimulus for talk of inequity is a comparison between indi­
viduals or groups, then that comparison is also responsible for initiation
of counter-control. Once successful, however, counter-control becomes
a permanent part of a relationship because it helps to keep the com­
pared individuals or groups on par - that is, it prevents the inequity
from recurring. It is also a mechanism by which relationships can
keep changing for the better.
Since talk about inequity changes from time to time, new calls for
counter-control can arise. This occurs when a new comparison is
made. As social stratification breaks down, people of a lower class or
caste begin to compare their circumstances with those of the strata
above them (formerly their "betters"). Historians attribute the French
Revolution to the dissatisfaction of the new middle class over their
lack of political power in comparison with the aristocracy. Since threats
failed to change the king's behavior, the middle class rebelled, and
established a new form of government that afforded the middle class
more power - that is, more effective counter-control. In a truly class­
less society, comparisons would be general in the extreme; any indi­
vidual or group might be compared with any other. The ideal "From
each according to his ability, to each according to his need" was partly
responsible for the Russian Revolution.

Social Issues

Relationships. Management. and Government

The ultimate equity is equality. In a relationship between equals,
not only is there equity in the sense that no unfavorable comparison
exists, but also the comparison is made between the parties in the
relationship. Before the twentieth century, the relationship between a
wife and a husband was considered unequal; nowadays, however,
equity-comparisons are often made between husband and wife, instead
of between this husband and other husbands or this wife and other
wives. In other words, we suggest that the two spouses should be
equally satisfied with the relationship.
If we stick to our earlier definition of peers as equals who receive
the same reinforcers, most equals would not be called peers because
they receive different reinforcers in the relationship. We say of a hus­
band and wife that the sources of their satisfaction differ because the
reinforcers in their relationship - S� and S� in figures 11.1 and 11.3 differ in kind, but they may report and otherwise behave so that they
and others say they are equally satisfied. When this verbal behavior
occurs, it sets the occasion for saying also that the parties are equals.
In terms of equity theory, advocating equality means that the two
parties' investments must be viewed as equal, ignoring any differ­
ences in gender, race, looks, or education. In practice, people rarely
behave this way. The whole point of equity theory is to explain how'
people are able to call unequal relationships equitable. It admits the
possibility, however, that investments could be equal; then equity
would require that profits also be equal.
In the special case of relationships between equals, the distinction
between control and counter-control disappears, because neither party
can be called controller or controllee - that is, neither gains more from
the relationship than the other. Each controls the behavior of the other
equally.
Shifting from partial equity to equality often leads to profound
changes in the relationship. When workers compare themselves only
with other workers, they can call a situation equitable even though
their employers profit from it more than they do. If the workers begin
to compare themselves with their employers, however, to achieve
equity they would have to achieve equality. Such movements lead to
employee-owned businesses or, on a larger scale, to government-owned
businesses and socialism.

Equity and power refer to different aspects of a relationship. Talk
about equity concerns the benefits derived from the relationship. Talk
about power concerns the degree of control each party exerts over
the behavior of the other. When the parties benefit unequally from
the relationship, the one who benefits more also has more power.
This greater power, as much as the greater benefit, leads to calling this
party the controller.
Strictly speaking, however, reinforcement relations are powerful,
not people. A person has power when he or she is the instrument of a
powerful relation. When an employer can deprive an employee of a
job for failure to perform, the employee's behavior is under control of
a powerful relation. A person's power depends entirely on the power
of the reinforcement relations he or she wields.
Two factors make a reinforcement relation powerful: the import­
ance of the reinforcer and the precision of control over the reinforcer.
The importance of the reinforcer depends not on its absolute value
but on its value relative to other reinforcers in the controllee's life. If
we say of Naomi that "her job is her life," we mean that there is little
else providing reinforcement in her life. We expect that losing her
job would be devastating and that Naomi will do almost anything to
retain her job, giving her employer enormous power in their relation­
ship. If, however, Naomi has many other relationships in her life parents, spouse, children, and friends - and particularly if she has
other sources of income, the job will have less importance. Then her
employer would be less able to control her behavior with the threat of
losing her job. In general, since employers are wealthier than their
employees, the benefits that employees derive from the relationship
have greater importance to the employees even though they are smaller
in absolute terms. By pooling the reinforcers that individual workers
control, unions allow workers partly to offset the difference in reinforcer
importance.
The same difference appears in other relationships between unequals.
The grade a teacher gives a student is usually more important to the
student than the student's approval is to the teacher. The parent's
affection is usually more important to the child than the child's affec­
tion is to the parent. The more powerful person controls the more
important reinforcer.
The way that reinforcer importance contributes to power is often
especially obvious in abnormal relationships. When the child's per­
formance is more important to the parent than the parent's affection is
to the child, the child bosses the parent. When students can threaten
the teacher with knives and guns, the teacher's behavior is very much
swayed by their approval. When an employee has vital skills that are
impossible to replace, the employee can order the employer around.

Power
Discussions about equity usually also involve discussion about power.
Definitions of power usually appeal to intuition or common sense.
Behavior analysis offers a path to a better understanding.

Relationships, M anagement, and Government

The power of these relations also depends on their precision. Even
if the reinforcers are important, the relation is less powerful if their
delivery is delayed or uncertain. The busy parent who has to tell the
child to wait until the weekend for some quality time has less power
to control the child's behavior. The employer who has to make wage
increases contingent on the business running a larger profit loses power
to control the employees' behavior. Totalitarian governments increase
the precision of aversive control by spying on their subjects (e.g., wire­
tapping), thereby making punishment for opposition more certain.
Unequal power may be the basis of unequal benefit. The one who
wields the more powerful reinforcement relations also reaps the greater
rewards. The controller reinforces controllee behavior that produces
the controller's greater reinforcement.
The inequity, however, is limited. If the controllee's reinforcement
drops too low or the demands of the reinforced behavior are too high,
counter-control becomes likely. When workers in one company are paid
less than those in another company, or find they cannot feed their
families on what they earn, they begin to leave, protest, and organize.
Depending on the comparison serving as the discriminative stimulus,
the controllee at some point declares that the controller is abusing his
or her power and that the relationship has become exploitive. Even it"
the controller's behavior continues to push the limit, still the imbal­
ance in power can sustain only a certain imbalance in benefits.
Counter-control acts to redress inequity by decreasing the imbalance
in power. Creating relations that reinforce or punish the controller's
behavior means that the controllee can reinforce (positively or negat­
ively; offering promises or threats) the controller's more giving actions.
To avert a rebellion, the dictator lowers taxes. For the sake of a promised
gain in quality control, the industrialist institutes employee profit­
sharing. Since counter-control increases the relative power of the con­
trollee, it produces more equity by decreasing the imbalance of power,
and in the extreme, both benefit and power become equal. When, for
example, a husband and wife have an equal relationship, their behavior
is not only reinforced equally, but other sources of reinforcement make
the reinforcement in the marriage equally important to both.

It is true, as we saw in chapter 9, that citizens in a democracy feel
relatively free and happy. We could, however, imagine a benevolent
dictator who controlled the citizens' behavior with positive reinforce­
ment. With such a government, the citizens might feel free, but they
would be powerless to ensure the dictator's continued benevolence.
The ingredient in democracy that safeguards the people's freedom is
counter-control.
Democracy provides citizens with reinforcement relations with which
to control the behavior of their rulers. In the United States, the presid­
ent and members of Congress periodically come up for evaluation,
with the possibilities of being reelected or replaced. If we don't like
what they do, we can throw them out.
Counter-control in a democracy can be by threat or by promise. The
threat would be that if the ruler's policies (EXl and BX2 in figure 11.3)
produce punishing consequences (S�) for the constituents, then the
citizens will vote (Bd for someone else and dismiss the ruler (S�) .
Such threats are made explicit at demonstrations and rallies. The prom­
ise would be that if the policies produce reinforcers (S�), then the
constituents will vote for the ruler ( BR3) and return the ruler to office
(S�). In everyday terms, we call counter-control by promise lobbying.
Democracy is also characterized by a type of equality, symbolized
in the French and Russian revolutions by calling everyone "citizen"
and "comrade." The relationship between the president and the citizens
of the United States cannot be a relationship between equals; while in
office, the rulers in a democracy clearly are controllers. Once out of
office, however, they again become ordinary citizens - controllees like
everyone else. In the long run, they are subject to the same reinforce­
ment relations as everyone else.
Democratic rulers' policies sooner or later affect the rulers themselves.
Even while in office, the president and members of Congress must pay
taxes. Once out of office, they are even more subject to their own pol­
icies. In the long run, democracy tends to take the relationship between
controllers and controllees beyond partial equity toward equality.
This description of democracy is, of course, an idealization. Govern­
ment officials sometimes engage in secret illegal action and sometimes
take bribes. An ex-president only partly returns to the status of ordin­
ary citizen. As a whole, however, democracy is generally considered
an improvement over absolute systems of government such as mon­
archy and dictatorship. The imperfection of democratic processes, how­
ever, suggests that they could be improved further: perhaps still better
means of counter-control can be found. We will discuss how a society
might make such improvements in chapter 14, when we take up social
engineering.

Democracy
Why is democracy such a popular form of government? Traditional
answers refer to citizens' feelings of freedom and happiness. Behavior
analysis allows a fuller and clearer understanding of the virtues of
democracy.

Social Issues

Summary
For an episode between two parties to be called a social interaction,
each party must reinforce the other's behavior - the reinforcement
must be mutual. Examples discussed in earlier chapters include verbal
behavior and coercion. Two individuals are said to have a relation­
ship when social interactions occur between them frequently. This
same conception applies to relationships between individuals and
organizations.
Although relationships based on coercion are obviously inequitable,
a subtler form of inequity marks exploitive relationships, in which
both parties' actions are positively reinforced. These are said to be
inequitable because one party is cheated in the long run; the exploited
party's participation in the relationship is ultimately severely pun­
ished. In the short run, the person being cheated might remain con­
tent; such a person is called a "happy slave./I In the long run, happy
slaves often discover or are told about the cheating - that is, they
encounter discriminative stimuli that make disaffection and rebellion
likely. This long-term instability makes exploitation, like coercion, a
poor method of management.
More so than for coercive relationships, the tendency for rebellion
against exploitive relationships depends on verbal behavior of people
in the society. Talk about exploitation tends to occur in the same
contexts as talk about unfairness and inequity. A comparison is made
between two individuals or two groups, and the poorly treated person
or group is said to be exploited. Since the comparison made depends
on the speaker's history of reinforcement, talk of exploitation, equity,
and inequity varies from person to person and time to time.
Coercion and exploitation are redressed by changing the relation­
ship. Relationships can be severed, but often less drastic changes can
allow the relationship to continue. The move toward greater equality
occurs as a result of added reinforcement relations, or counter-control.
The controller is offered a choice of an alternative relationship, a
modification of the existing one, and discriminative stimuli from the
controllee that point to superior long-term consequences for the con­
troller increase the likelihood that the controller will adopt the new
course of action. Counter-control operates by promise and by threat,
by stimuli (rules) pointing to future reinforcement and avoidance
of future punishment. The threats and promises, backed up by social
reinforcement, help the controller to avoid impulsively choosing the
relationship that is more profitable in the short run and instead to
choose the relationship that is better in the long run (self-control) .

Relationships, Management, and Government

235

Introducing a new relation by which the controllee can affect the con­
troller's behavior (counter-control) changes the relationship toward
grea ter equity. When mutual reinforcement in a relationship is equit­
able in the long run, the relationship is often called cooperation.
When new comparisons occur, a relationship may change further. If
the new comparisons are made to a broader reference group, the rela­
tionship moves toward greater equity and, ultimately, to equality, in
which the parties in the relationship are compared to one another. In a
relationship between equals, both parties benefit equally. When rein­
forcement is equal, the distinctions between control versus counter­
control and controller versus controllee disappear, because each party
controls the other's behavior equally.
The control that each party in a relationship exerts over the other's
behavior is the party's power or, more precisely, the power of the rein­
forcement relations by which that party controls the other's behavior.
The power of a relation depends on the importance of the reinforcer
and the precision of control over the reinforcer. The more important
the reinforcer and the greater the precision of control over it, the more
powerful is the relation. An imbalance of power in the reinforcement
relations of a relationship leads to inequality of benefit derived from
the relationship. Since counter-control increases the controllee's power,
it tends to reduce inequity by decreasing the imbalance of power.
The great strength of democracy is that it gives the people, the
controllees, counter-control. Counter-control occurs by means of elec­
tions, demonstrations, and lobbying. Although the relationship remains
unequal, even with counter-control, the limited term of office of the
rulers ensures long-term equality, because on the rulers' return to being
ordinary citizens they are subject to the same reinforcement relations
as everyone else. When everyone's behavior is subject to the same
relations, everyone is equal. That, at least, is the theory; democracy as
actually practiced may be open to improvement.

Values: Religion and Science

Questions about values are questions about good and bad, right and
. wrong. Growing up in a culture, we learn to call certain things and
activities good, and we strive after those things and engage in those
activities. We learn to call certain things and activities bad, and we
avoid those things and shun those activities. The approbation of one's
fellows is good, honest labor is good, illness is bad, and meanness is
bad. In this chapter we accept that these things and activities are called
good and bad, are embraced or avoided. We are interested in how to
explain the behavior of calling them good and bad.
In the traditional view, values are ideas or attitudes, mental things
somewhere inside. To religious-minded people, these mental values
come from God. This assumed divine origin underlies the quote from
C. S. Lewis at the end of chapter 9 that says science can shed no light
on questions of value, that it can tell us how we do behave but not
how we ought to behave. Behaviorists today disagree with Lewis; it is
possible for science to shed some light on questions about how we
ought to behave.

Questions about Value
Behaviorists reject the notion that values are mental entities; if they
are anything, they are behavior. Lewis is correct that science has noth­
ing to say about what is good or bad in the eyes of God, but it may
have plenty to say about what is good or bad in the eyes of people.
Even if Lewis is correct that behavior analysis can only address what
people do, one of the things people do is to talk about how people

238

Social Issues

ought to behave. Behavior analysis can approach questions about
value by focusing on what people do, and particularly what they say
(their verbal behavior) concerning good and bad and right and wrong.
Science can inquire into why people make the value statements
they do.

Moral Relativism
Talk about values seems to vary so much from person to person,
place to place, and culture to culture that some thinkers throw up
their hands and say no universal standard exists to explain ideas
about right and wrong. Such thinkers talk of situational ethics - ethics
born of particular situations, rather than universal principles - as
the only possibility. In other words, these moral relativists hold
that each person develops his or her own ideas about good and bad
relative to his or her particular situation. The extension of such
thinking is the dictum "Nothing is good or bad but thinking makes
it so."
One problem with moral relativism is that it appears to offer no
means for resolving conflicts between people whose ideas of good
and bad differ. To take an extreme example, suppose a sadist finds it
good to inflict pain on other people. If there is no universal standard,
how can we conclude that his actions are bad? What could limit the
notion " If it feels good, do it"?
Moral relativism answers such questions by pointing to social con­
ventions. A group can decide what behavior they will call good or
bad, and then that convention becomes part of the individual's situ­
ation. The sadist can be taught that the group rejects such behavior.
A view like this, however, leaves open some basic questions: (1) How
would a group arrive at conventions of good and bad? (2) How would
the group persuade individuals to accept the conventions?

Ethical Standards
The alternative to strict moral relativism is the idea that universal
ethical standards or principles can be discovered by which we can
explain people's assertions about good and bad as an outcome of
more than their particular situations. Both the religious Lewis and
the behaviorist Skinner rejected moral relativism in favor of universal
ethical standards. Their ideas about what standard to apply differed,
of course, particularly in respect to the origins of such a standard.

Values: Religion and Science

239

The law of human nature
Lewis (1960) begins with the observation that people often quarrel
over what is fair:
I believe we can learn something very important from listening to the
kinds of things they say. They say things like this: " How'd you like it if
anyone did the same to you?" - "That's my seat, I was there first" "Leave him alone, he isn't doing you any harm" - "Why should you
shove in first?" - "Give me a bit of your orange, I gave you a bit of
mine" - "Come on, you promised." (p. 17)

From Lewis's point of view, such statements suggest that when
people quarrel they appeal to an ethical standard that they assume
everyone shares:
Now what interests me about all these remarks is that the man who
makes them is not merely saying that the other man's behaviour does
not happen to please him. He is appealing to some kind of standard of
behaviour which he expects the other man to know about. And the
other man very seldom replies: "To hell with your standard." Nearly
always he tries to make out that what he has been doing does not really
go against the standard, or that if it does there is some special excuse.
He pretends there is some special reason in this particular case why the
person who took the seat first should not keep it, or that things were
quite different when he was given the bit of orange, or that something
has turned up which lets him off keeping his promise. It looks, in fact
very much as if both parties had in mind some kind of Law or Rule of
fair play or decent behaviour or morality or whatever you like to call it,
about which they really agreed. And they have. (p. 17)

This " law or rule" that everyone agrees on Lewis calls the " Law of
Human Nature." He carefully explains, as we saw in chapter 9, that
this law is not about what we do, but about what we ought to do. It is
a law that can be - and often is - disobeyed.
Reading between the lines, we can see that Lewis's law concerns
kindness and fairness. It comes down to the Golden Rule: Do unto
others as you would have them do unto you. To Lewis, apparently,
We break the rule out of self-interest, and he is asking why we ever
obey it. He implies that our only reason to act selflessly is our God­
given inner sense of what is right.
Lewis overlooks the possibility that people might also obey the
Golden Rule out of self-interest. In keeping with our discussion of
rules in chapter 8, this rule points to long-term consequences in the

240

Social Issues

likelihood of reciprocation: When we do nice things for others, they
often do nice things for us. We resist breaking the rule openly because
if we act selfishly toward others they are likely to respond by acting
selfishly toward us.
In the more technical terms of chapter 11, the Golden Rule man­
dates equity. If you fail to reinforce the other person's behavior suffi­
ciently, the desired behavior will disappear. If Naomi gives Shona a
piece of orange, and then Shona refuses to give Naomi a piece of
orange, it becomes unlikely that Naomi will give Shona anything else.
If Zack breaks his promise to Gideon, it becomes unlikely that Gideon's
behavior will again be controlled by a promise of Zack's (a rule;
chapter 8). Doing unto others as you would have them do unto you
means that you reinforce others' behavior and they reinforce yours.
Evolutionary biologists also recognize altruism (being good to
others) and reciprocity (considerations of long-term equity) as human
universals. (They also recognize other cultural universals, like marriage,
property rights, and recognition of relatives.) The biologists' reason­
ing parallels Lewis's: Wherever we look, we find that people share
and make sacrifices for others (practice altruism) at least some of the
time; that cheating (failure to reciprocate in the long run) occurs too; ·
and that cheating is punished, particularly by those who are cheated.
The universality of these phenomena does suggest that kindness and
fairness constitute a law of human nature.
In contrast to Lewis, however, evolutionists and behaviorists see the
regularities of human behavior to reflect only various forms of selfish­
ness. Naomi gives Shona a piece of orange only if Shona is likely to
reciprocate - reinforce Naomi's act of giving - in the long run. Gideon
may donate time and money to his church, but only as long as he gets
something back in the long run. Cheating and verbal behavior that
may avoid punishment for cheating ("pretending" according to Lewis)
differ from the "correct" behavior only in that they are reinforced
more immediately. They constitute only a more obvious form of selfish­
ness - acting so as to produce short-term reinforcers. Thus, altruism,
because it enhances one's long-term benefit, is still selfish.
The great exception to human selfishness occurs in behavior toward
relatives. Parents, in particular, make sacrifices for their children with
no expectation of repayment. Brothers and sisters often help one another
out even if reciprocity is unlikely, or openly disavow any need for
repayment. Uncles and aunts help their nieces and nephews. A well­
to-do person may even help a cousin with no ability to reciprocate.
The exceptions, however, prove the rule. The universality of altruism
suggests a genetic base. Genes for altruism toward relatives would be
selected because relatives share those genes and helping relatives tends

Values: Religion and Science

24 1

to increase the frequency of the shared genes in the gene pool. Genes
that promote altruism toward nonrelatives can be selected as long as
they go along with genes that make for sensitivity to long-term rein­
forcement. This brings us to the question of origins: Where did the law
of human nature come from?

The q uestion of origins
Lewis rejects the moral relativists' idea that agreed-on values are
simply social conventions, as do evolutionists and behaviorists. Here
is how he addresses the question "Isn't what you call the Moral Law
just a social convention, something that is put into us by education?":
I fully agree that we learn the Rule of Decent Behaviour from parents
and teachers, and friends and books, as we learn everything else. But
some of the things we learn are mere conventions which might have
been different - we learn to keep to the left of the road, but it might just
as well have been the rule to keep to the right - and others of them, like
mathematics, are real truths. The question is to which class the Law of
Human Nature belongs. (p. 24)

Lewis, of course, argues that this law is a "real truth," not one of
those conventions that might have been different. He goes to some
lengths to reject a related explanation, that decent conduct benefits
one's society as a whole, stating the argument this way: "Human
beings, after all, have some sense; they see that you cannot have real
safety or happiness except in a society where every one plays fair,
and it is because they see this that they try to behave decently." He
dismisses the explanation this way:
Now, of course, it is perfectly true that safety and happiness can only
come from individuals, classes, and nations being honest and fair and
kind to each other. It is one of the most important truths in the world.
But as an explanation of why we feel as we do about Right and Wrong
it just misses the point. If we ask: "Why ought I to be unselfish?" and
you reply, "Because it is good for society," we may then ask, " Why
should I care what's good for society except when it happens to pay me
personally?" and then you will have to say, " Because you ought to be
unselfish" - which simply brings us back to where we started. (p. 29)

To Lewis, some additional factor, some ultimate reason, must
explain "why we feel as we do about Right and Wrong" and why we
ought to behave unselfishly.

242

Social Issues

Values: Religion and Science

Evolutionary biologists make a similar argument against explana­
tions of altruism that appeal to acting for "the good of the species" or
group selection. If individuals behaved so as to enhance the fitness
of the group at their own expense, then any member of the group
that acted selfishly - enjoying benefits of being in the group without
making sacrifices (i.e., cheating) - would have higher fitness than the
rest. Selfish types would increase in numbers and eventually undo the
social arrangement. Any social system based on the good of the group
would be vulnerable to disruption by cheaters unless some larger
consideration, ultimately selfish, could constrain individuals to remain
altruistic.
Although the religious and evolutionary accounts of values agree
that some ultimate factor or absolute standard must explain our values,
this is as far as their agreement goes. Lewis proposes that the law of
human nature comes from God, whereas evolutionists argue that it is
the result of natural selection.

unknown to men or else make itself known in some different way. The
statement that there is any such thing, and the statement that there is
no such thing, are neither of them statements that science can make
. . . After all, it is really a matter of common sense. Supposing science
ever became complete so that it knew every single thing in the whole
universe. Is it not plain that the questions, "Why is there a universe?"
" Why does it go on as it does?" " Has it any meaning?" would remain
just as they were? (p. 32)

243

Recognizing the correctness of Lewis's general argument that some
questions lie outside the scope of science, we can disagree with his
assertions about the law of human nature coming from Beyond, as
long as we focus on what people do and say that conforms to the law.
We can explain why people behave unselfishly (altruistically) and why
they speak of selfish behavior as bad and unselfish as good. As before,
we will rely on basic behavior-analytic concepts like reinforcement,
verbal behavior, and stimulus control.

A Scientific Approach to Values
Reinforcers and Punishers
A scientific account of values cannot appeal to supernatural causes
like God. Can behaviorists, contrary to Lewis's contention, say any­
thing about what we ought to do, beyond what we, in fact, do?
The answer is yes and no. Behavior analysts can offer accounts of
what people do that is considered good and bad and particularly
people's verbal behavior about good and bad and right and wrong ­
that is, accounts of what people say about what we ought to do. A
religious person like Lewis, however, could remain dissatisfied with
such explanations and demand to know why the universe is arranged
in such a way that we should come to say things like Thou shalt not
steal to one another. Even if we can explain how that came about,
given the way the world is, the question remains as to why the world
should be that way. As Lewis (1960) said:
Science works by experiments. It watches how things behave. Every
scientific statement in the long run, however complicated it looks, really
means something like, "1 pointed the telescope to such and such a part
of the sky at 2:20 A.M. on January 15th and saw so-and-so," or, "1 put
some of this stuff in a pot and heated it to such-and-such a temperature
and it did so-and-so." . . . But why anything comes to be there at all,
and whether there is anything behind the things science observes something of a different kind - this is not a scientific question. If there
is "Something Behind," then either it will have to remain altogether

Skinner (1971) offered a simple rule of thumb: Things that are called
good are positive reinforcers. Things that are called bad are punishers.
Activities that are called good are those that are reinforced. Activities
that are called bad are those that are punished.
Some things and activities are good or bad because of the way our
bodies are constructed. Health is good; illness is bad. Food and eating
are good; pain and falling down are bad. Affection is good; rejection
is bad.
Acquired reinforcers and punishers are called good and bad because
they have been associated with unconditional reinforcers and punishers.
Money is good; the signs of illness are bad. An A is a good grade; an
F is a bad grade. Both their power as consequences and their verbal
labels derive from a person's history. They vary from time to time, per­
son to person, and culture to culture. The behavior of many children
in the US may be reinforced with baseball cards, and these children
call baseball cards good. This is rarely true for adults, but for some
adults the cards remain reinforcers. For a person living in a village in
India, baseball cards are unlikely to serve as reinforcers or to be called
good; neither are baseball cards associated with unconditional rein­
forcers, nor is the verbal behavior or calling them good reinforced.
Most acquired reinforcers and punishers result from our living in
society with other people. Grades, medals, reprimands, praise, getting

Social Issues

Values: Religion and Science

to work on time, catching the bus - the power of all these consequences
is social in origin, the outcome of reinforcement arranged by the group.
All of them are called good or bad according to whether they reinforce
or punish behavior that produces them. Reprimands are bad; they
punish lying, cheating, tardiness, sloppiness, and so on. Getting to work
is good; it reinforces rising early, eating quickly, catching the bus, and
so on.
If most things called good or bad are called so because of social
arrangements, so too most activities called good or bad are called so
because of social arrangements - that is, because they are reinforced or
punished by other people. A child's sharing with siblings and friends
is called good and reinforced by parents and teachers. Donating to
charity is called good and reinforced by friends, newspaper columnists,
and the Internal Revenue Service (by reduction of taxes). Lying is called
bad and is punished by parents, teachers, and friends. Giving and
accepting bribes is called bad and is punished by the judicial system.
Skinner's rule of thumb about reinforcement being good and punish­
ment being bad implies a rule about value judgments - verbal behavior
involving good, bad, right, and wrong. The utterance Cheating is wrong
occurs because utterances like it have been reinforced by parents and
teachers. Thus, someone who never met with approval for such utter­
ances would never call cheating wrong, yet this person might never
cheat if his or her history has included reinforcement of honesty and
punishment of cheating. Another person might call cheating wrong
and yet frequently cheat. Usually, however, people whose cheating
has been punished are also people whose verbal behavior of calling
cheating wrong has been reinforced. Calling reinforcers good and rein­
forced behavior right and calling punishers bad and punished behavior
wrong is verbal behavior that is usually reinforced.
This account may shed some light on why we call things and activ­
ities good and bad, but it leaves at least two fundamental questions
unanswered. First, we have strong feelings about right and wrong about the Rule of Decent Behavior, as Lewis would call it. When we
do something good, we feel good; when we do something bad, we feel
bad. It is often suggested that we call things good or bad because of
the way we feel about them. How are feelings related to things we call
good and bad?
Second, even if it is true that good and bad activities are those that
are reinforced and punished in our society, we have yet to explain
why our society customarily reinforces and punishes those particular
activities. What is it about good and bad activities that leads the group
to reinforce and punish them? This is the puzzle that Lewis raised
and answered by appealing to God. Behavior analysts today generally

follow Skinner's (1971, 1981) lead and answer it by appealing to evolu­
tionary theory, as we will see in this chapter and the next. We will first
take up the question of the role of feelings and then turn to the role of
evolution.

Feelings
Skinner (1971) discussed the difference between what we do and
what we ought to do as an example of the difference between a fact
and the way we feel about the fact. Although people readily embrace
this distinction, Skinner pointed out that to a behavior analyst both
an activity and our feeling about it are facts to be explained: " How
people feel about facts, or what it means to feel anything, is a question
for which a science of behavior should have an answer. A fact is no
doubt different from what a person feels about it, but the latter is a
fact also" (p. 103). If Gideon loses his temper, shouts at Shona, and
then feels terrible about it afterwards, the behavior analyst needs to
explain not only Gideon's shouting but also his feeling terrible.
Both Gideon's shouting and his feeling bad are activities. His feel­
ing bad includes his hanging his head and talking about how badly he
feels. Such reports of feeling good or feeling bad are instances of self­
knowledge (chapter 6). To understand the reports, we need to examine
a person's history of reinforcement and punishment. Not everyone
feels badly when he or she shouts at someone else, so why does Gideon?
Most likely, his shouting was frequently punished over the years by
parents, teachers, and friends. The result is that when he misbehaves
he acts unhappy and reports feeling anxiety, shame, and guilt.
Skinner argued that such reports are verbal behavior under the dis­
criminative control of conditions of the body. The conditions can be
at least partially public, as when changes in heart rate, breathing,
stomach, and sweat glands are recorded in emotionally charged situ­
ations. Public or private, they serve as discriminative stimuli, which
along with external circumstances (the shouting, the hurt expression
on Shona's face) set the occasion for reports of feeling bad, ashamed,
and guilty. Reports of feeling good occur in situations like those in
which behavior has been reinforced in the past. Naomi's report that
she feels good when she gets an A in a course results from bodily
conditions that are also labeled "joy" and "ecstasy."
The reports, however, do not explain why the situations that occa­
sion them are called good and bad; rather, the reports about feelings and
the utterances about good and bad both arise from the same source:
history. The feelings and the value judgments stem from two parallel

246

Social Issues

histories of reinforcement and punishment. Skinner attributed the
bodily conditions to respondent conditioning; they are physiological
reactions to situations in which reinforcers and punishers (phylogenetic­
ally important events; chapter 4) have occurred in the person's past.
They arose as by-products of the operant relations that controlled the
reinforcers and punishers - that is, the relations that shaped (encour­
aged or discouraged) the behavior that is called good or bad. The
utterances about good and bad proceed from a parallel set of relations
in which labels of good were reinforced in the presence of reinforcers
and reinforced behavior and in which labels of bad were reinforced in
the presence of punishers and punished behavior. Having yelled at
Shona, Gideon says both that he did something wrong and that he
feels bad, but he does not do the one because of the other; the two
verbal actions proceed from two overlapping, but different, histories
of reinforcement.
The difference between the histories explains why people can talk
about good or bad without necessarily feeling good or bad. Discus­
sions of right and wrong often engender passion, but they can proceed '
calmly. I may say that I am right to carry insurance without having
any special feelings about it.
The history of value statements apart from feelings allows us to
understand the use of words like ought and should. Statements invol­
ving these words are rules in the sense of chapter 8 (i.e., verbal discrim­
inative stimuli). If Naomi says to Zack, "To get to the bank, you should
turn left at the corner," she could just as well have said, "If you turn
left, that action will be reinforced by your getting to the bank." The
should is a cue to Zack that his behavior could be reinforced. Rules are
usually called value judgments when they point to social reinforce­
ment, in which reinforcers are delivered by other people. Skinner (1971)
argued that a statement like "You should ( you ought to) tell the truth"
is a value judgment in the sense that it points to reinforcement rela­
tions. It could be translated to something like " If the approval of other
people is reinforcing for you, then your telling the truth will be rein­
forced." He commented, "It is an ethical or moral judgment in the
sense that ethos and mores refer to the customary practices of a group"
( pp. 112-13). In the terms of chapter 8, Skinner was arguing that a
value judgment is a rule that points to ultimate reinforcement that is
social in nature, the result of the " customary practices" of the group to ·
which speaker and listener belong. If the listener's behavior conforms
to the group's practices, the listener will reap the benefits of belong­
ing to the group (e.g., approval, but also resources and opportunities
to reproduce). To discuss cultural practices (chapter 13) and morals
(below) we must first revisit evolutionary theory.

Values: Religion and Science

247

Evolutionary Theory and Values
Our discussion thus far has left unanswered a basic question, or, as
Lewis might say, the "real question." If good things and activities are
reinforcers and reinforced activities, and bad things and activities are
punishers and punished activities, then what makes reinforcers rein­
forcing and punishers punishing?
Chapter 4 sketched a partial answer: fitness. Food is a reinforcer to
a deprived organism because those types in a population that are
organized because of their genotype so that food should be a reinforcer
outreproduce other types not so organized. Pain is a punisher because
those types that are organized so that the bodily harm inducing pain
should be a punisher outreproduce other types not so organized.
Occasionally, because of genetic defect, someone is born without the
capacity to be punished by painful stimulation. Such people injure
themselves frequently and survive childhood only with constant vigil­
ance by their caretakers. Similar problems would arise with people
deficient in other personal reinforcers and punishers: shelter, sex,
excessive hot and cold, nausea, and so on.
Since our species is social, the fitness of our genes is often tied up
with our behavior toward one another. The benefits of group living can
be bought only at the expense of mechanisms that make us sensitive to
and dependent on one another. Not only the approval of our fellows, but
their well-being often weighs heavily with us. Not only a baby's cry, but
signs of distress even in a stranger are usually aversive. Some experi­
ments show that behaving altruistically toward others functions as a
reinforcer even apart from any other personal gain. Our short-term indi­
vidual interests are often sacrificed on the altar of the greater good of
the group, which turns out to be our own greater good in the long run.
More precisely, the greater good in the long run is the greater good
of one's genes. The evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins (1989) puts
the position vividly by describing organisms as "survival machines"
that make " gambles" depending on the way their genes have organized
their bodies:
Prediction in a complex world is a chancy business. Every decision that
a survival machine takes is a gamble, and it is the business of genes
to program brains in advance so that on average they take decisions
that pay off. The currency used in the casino of evolution is survival,
strictly gene survival, but for many purposes individual survival is a
reasonable approximation. If you go down to the water-hole to drink,
you increase your risk of being eaten by predators who make their
living lurking for prey by water-holes. If you do not go down to the

Social Issues

Value s : Rel igio n and Science

water-hole you will eventually die of thirst. There are risks whichever
way you turn, and you must take the decision that maximizes the long­
term survival chances of your genes . . . Some form of weighing up the
odds has to be done. But of course we do not have to think of the
animals as making the calculations consciously. All we have to believe
is that those individuals whose genes build brains in such a way that
they tend to gamble correctly are as a direct result more likely to sur­
vive, and therefore to propagate those same genes. (pp. 55-6)

copulating are likely to be beneficial to gene survival. The possibilities
of saccharine and masturbation are not anticipated according to this
example; nor are the dangers of over-eating sugar in our environment
where it exists in unnatural plenty. (p. 57)

248

"Gambles" and "decisions" here refer to behavior and usually, in
our species, learned behavior. From the point of view of genes, learn­
ing implies still more " gambling," because the genes can be less
assured that the organism will behave correctly. Relinquishing some
control to experience with the environment may enhance survival; if
so, genes that allow this will flourish. However, genes will be selected
that limit what activities are likely to be learned and what aspects of
the environment are likely to control behavior if those genes generally
tend the organism to make good gambles. That is why genes make
for learning, but only to a limited extent. One way that genes retain .
control is to set the things that will be good and bad or reinforcers and
punishers. Dawkins (1989) writes of operant learning:
One way for genes to solve the problem of making predictions in rather
unpredictable environments is to build in a capacity for learning. Here
the program may take the form of the following instructions to the
survival machine: " Here is a list of things defined as rewarding: sweet
taste in the mouth, orgasm, mild temperature, smiling child. And here
is a list of nasty things: various sorts of pain, nausea, empty stomach,
screaming child. If you should happen to do something that is followed
by one of the nasty things, don't do it again, but on the other hand
repeat anything that is followed by one of the nice things." The advant­
age of this sort of programming is that it greatly cuts down the number
of detailed rules that have to be built into the original program; and it is
also capable of coping with changes in the environment that could not
have been predicted in detail. (p. 57)

Genes that define reinforcers and punishers and provide the means
for operant learning will be selected in a species like ours, which lives
in an uncertain environment. In turn, the reinforcers and punishers
define what is good and bad, even when the gamble has gone awry
and behavior fails to advance fitness or even decreases fitness. Dawkins
continues:
In our example the genes are predicting that sweet taste in the mouth,
and orgasm, are going to be "good" in the sense that eating sugar and

249

This last point deserves emphasis: Sugar " exists in unnatural plenty"
in our environment because our environment has changed. The envir­
onment in which the genes were selected that made sweet taste a
reinforcer is no longer with us. Sugar is now plentiful because of
cultural change, and cultural change is so rapid in comparison with
evolutionary change that shifts in the gene pool can never keep up.
But cultural change continues, and now it has become bad to eat too
much sugar and good to watch one's diet. These labels, however, have
to do with more than the individual because they depend on group
practices of reinforcement and punishment. We will return to culture
and cultural change in chapter 13.

Altruism
According to both evolutionary theory and behavior analysis, true
altruism in the sense of self-sacrifice with no possibility of long-term
gain cannot occur. Evolutionary biologists point out that altruism is
most often directed toward kin. Self-sacrifice for the sake of kin can
be selected because the kin share the genes making for the altruistic
behavior; even if the altruist loses out personally, the genes may
increase through the benefit to the kin. Biologists argue further that
self-sacrifice extends to strangers only when reciprocation is likely when, for example, group membership requires self-sacrifice as the
price of the benefits of group membership. People are much more
likely to help someone who belongs to their club, their neighborhood,
or their race than someone who is utterly unrelated.
Behavior analysts take this line a step further by noting that altruistic
behavior depends on reinforcement. Skinner (1971), for example, con­
sidered acting for the good of others to be an outcome of social rein­
forcement. He argued that when other people arrange for a person's
behavior to be reinforced, the person affected "may be said to be
behaving 'for the good of others'" (pp. 108-9). The recipient of the
altruism may benefit more immediately, but the altruist benefits
ultimately too. People behave altruistically toward others under two
circumstances: (1) when they are involved in relationships with them,
as described in chapter 11, so that the other party ultimately reciproc­
ates, or (2) when some third party arranges that the action will be
reinforced. A babysitter sacrifices time and effort and sometimes risks

Social Issues

Values: Religion and Science

personal injury for the sake of another person's child, but is rewarded
in the end by money and approval from the child's parents. Govern­
ments require citizens to sacrifice by paying taxes, but paying taxes is
reinforced in the long run by services such as schools and garbage
collection. (Of course, paying your taxes also prevents fines, jail, and
other forms of punishment.)
The long-term reinforcement helps us to understand why altruism
occurs, but the deferred nature of the reinforcement helps us to under­
stand why altruism often fails to occur. In the terms of chapters 9
(figure 9.2) and 11, selfish behavior usually constitutes impulsiveness,
and altruism usually constitutes self-control. People often behave
selfishly because the reinforcement for selfishness is relatively imme­
diate. There is much evil in the world. People lie, cheat, steal, and
murder because such behavior pays off in the short run.
A large part of what we call "socialization" consists of bringing
behavior into contact with long-term consequences that reinforce kind­
ness and generosity. Verbal behavior about doing good unto others
provides rules (in the sense of chapters 8 and 11) that help people to
avoid the reinforcement traps of selfishness. We saw such a reinforce­
ment trap in figure 11.3, in which a controller has to choose between
an exploitive relationship that pays off in the short run and a more
cooperative relationship that pays off in the long run. The controllee
provides a rule (e.g., a promise or threat) that promotes the choice that
is better in the long run. As we saw in chapters 8 and 9, such rules are
usually backed up with relatively short-term social reinforcers (e.g.,
approval) . Evil exists because the rules and social reinforcement may
be ineffective or altogether absent from a person's environment. To
the extent that people behave well, however, the social training works.
Apparently altruistic behavior is never devoid of self-interest, because
ultimately it can be traced to genetic influence, a history of reinforce­
ment, or, most often, both. People are usually good to their siblings
and cousins both because they share genes with these relatives and
because they were taught to do so - the "good" actions were rein­
forced by parents and other family members.
Because they are reinforced, altruistic acts are called " good." When
a church teaches its congregants that it is good to help others in
distress, this verbal behavior points to the likelihood that charitable
actions will be reinforced by approval and status in the church. A
verbal discriminative stimulus that labels an action as good or pairs
should or ought with the name of the activity constitutes a rule in the
sense of chapter 8. In the long run, since the behavior of both the
speaker and the listener is reinforced, the good behavior usually con­
stitutes rule-governed behavior in the context of a relationship.

Although Lewis (1960) was correct that science cannot address
ultimate questions like "Why does the universe exist?" he was incor­
rect when he argued that science could have nothing to say about
what is right or wrong or what people ought to do. Even if no scientist
can say why the universe is arranged so that societies come to be the
way they are, behavior analysts can explain conventions (i.e., verbal
behavior) about right, wrong, and ought - the law of human nature as an outcome of genetic effects and operant learning.

250

251

Morals
If quarrelsome statements like "Why should you shove in first?" or
"Give me a bit of your orange, I gave you a bit of mine," constitute
verbal behavior stemming from past reinforcement, the same applies
to moral judgments and injunctions. The commandment Thou shalt not
steal, which is equivalent to saying that stealing is wrong, is a rule in
the sense of chapter 8. It is a verbal discriminative stimulus that points
to customary punishment - stealing is an activity that is likely to be
punished in our society. As a discriminative stimulus, it decreases
the likelihood of stealing. The same can be said of the other nine
commandments.
Calling such statements commandments or injunctions separates them
from other rules, like advice. When a parent advises a child not to lie,
the punishment signaled is personal in nature; not only is lying punished
by our society, but the parent also disapproves. The verbal discriminat­
ive stimuli called morals, however, point only to the more general rein­
forcement and punishment resulting from the practices of the group.
Our discussion of rules in chapter 8 leads us to take these general
social reinforcement relations as proximate and to look further for
what ultimate consequences might explain the existence of the rule.
As we saw there (figure 8.2), we would be looking for an effect on
fitness (HRRR in chapter 8). Does stealing ultimately tend to lower an
individual's fitness? This question is best answered in a more general
discussion of where cultural practices, including moral commandments,
come from. We will take that up in chapter 13.
.

The good life
No discussion of values is complete without some attention to the
question of what is ultimate good. Toward what ultimate end are group
practices and verbal behavior about good and bad directed? Many
philosophers, economists, and other social scientists have wondered

Social Issues

Values: Religion and Science

whether human society could ever attain some ideal state and what
that ultimate good life would be like. Could we be working toward
some goal, some social arrangement which, if not ideal, might at least
be the best possible? Plato proposed monarchy with a philosopher­
king. The economist Jeremy Bentham proposed an economic arrange­
ment of "the greatest good for the greatest number."
Discussions that presuppose such an end state are often called
utopian, after the imaginary country Utopia (the Greek word for
"nowhere") that Thomas More wrote about. Would behavior analysts
propose some new utopia? Chapter 14 will give a fuller answer to this
question, but a brief answer can be given here.
Behavior analysts can no more specify where society is headed than
evolutionary biologists can predict where evolution might ultimately
end up. Although Skinner's novel Walden Two (1976) has often been
called utopian, Skinner always disavowed any such label, because for
him the imaginary community described in that book represented a
method rather than a goal.
Although behavior analysts cannot specify some ideal end state,
they can offer methods for change and for deciding whether changes
are sending society in the right direction. For instance, democracy has
proven to be a good practice because it has increased many people's
satisfaction over what went before and in comparison with existing
dictatorships. Democracy as we know it, however, may not be the final
word in governmental systems. Shockingly low percentages of people
vote in American elections. Too many people are uneducated, unem­
ployed, homeless. Can we make changes to increase participation? Can
we move away from coercive and exploitive arrangements to more
equitable ones? As we seek ways to eliminate the flaws in our system of
government, behavior analysts can suggest deliberate changes of rein­
forcement relations, to be made on an experimental basis and to be
assessed for their ability to increase societal satisfaction. These ideas of
social experimentation and assessment we will take up in chapter 14.

that all humans share in common. The religious C. S. Lewis argued
that everyone seems to have a grasp of the rules about how we ought
to behave, even if we often break those rules. Behavior analysts also
recognize such universals of decent behavior, in the form of altruism
and reciprocity. Lewis parts company with behavior analysts, how­
ever, over the question of origins. Whereas religious thinkers see the
standards of right and wrong as coming from God, behavior analysts
like Skinner see the standards as arising from evolutionary history.
Skinner's rule of thumb about good and bad is: Things called good
are positive reinforcers, things called bad are punishers, activities called
good are reinforced, and activities called bad are punished. Although
unconditional reinforcers and punishers, and activities associated with
them, come to be called good and bad because of the construction of
the world and our bodies, many things and activities also come to be
called good and bad because of our social environment, because much
of the reinforcement and punishment for one's behavior results from
the activities of other people. From early childhood, other people not
only train conditional reinforcers and punishers, but teach us to call
bad those things that punish and those activities that are punished
and to call good those things that reinforce and those activities that
are reinforced.
A person's history of reinforcement and punishment explains not
only why the person labels things good and bad but also why the
person feels good and bad about those things. People say they feel
bad in situations in which their behavior has been punished; the physio­
logical events called " feelings" serve, along with the public context, as
discriminative stimuli inducing such reports. People say they feel good,
for analogous reasons, in situations in which their behavior has been
reinforced. The feelings do not explain the talk about good and bad;
rather, the physiological events and reports of feeling good and bad
arise from a history of reinforcement and punishment that parallels
and partly overlaps the history that engenders talk about good and
bad things and activities (i.e., value judgments). Value judgments, most
clearly when they involve should or ought, are rules (verbal discriminat­
ive stimuli) that point to ultimate relations that are social - that is, that
arise from the practices of a group to which the listener belongs and
affect relationships with other members of the group.
When behavior analysts address the question of where reinforcers
and punishers, particularly social reinforcers and punishers, come
from, the answer is natural selection. Genes that made certain events
reinforcing or punishing, thereby promoting the reproductive success
of the individuals carrying them, are selected. This explains not only
why sweet tastes and orgasms are reinforcers, but also why helping

252

Summary
Behavior analysts approach questions about value by focusing on what .
people do and say about things and activities that are called good and
bad or right and wrong. Moral relativism, the idea that labels of good
and bad vary arbitrarily from culture to culture and arise strictly as
social conventions, is rejected by religious thinkers and behavior ana­
lysts, both groups instead favoring a universal standard, some principle

others of our own kind, even at our own expense, is a reinforcer.
Altruism toward offspring and other relatives is selected because
it promotes the shared altruism-inducing genes. Altruism toward
nonrelatives depends on long-term benefit to the altruist. Either the
nonrelative ultimately reciprocates because he or she is in a relation­
ship with the altruist, or practices of the group arrange for other mem­
bers of the group to ensure ultimate reinforcement. Either way, the
altruism ultimately benefits the altruist (i.e., is reinforced).
In the context of such social reinforcement relations, moral and
ethical injunctions constitute verbal discriminative stimuli (rules)
that point to ultimate social reinforcement or punishment. Behavior
analysis may help our society work toward " the good life" by offering
ways to identify and implement better social reinforcement.

The Evolution of Culture

If there is one thing that distinguishes human beings from other
species, it is culture - not in the sense of being better-educated or
highbrow, but culture in the sense of everyday customs shared and
passed on by a group of people. The world contains such a diversity
of cultures that for a time anthropologists who studied culture con­
centrated simply on classifying and cataloging human cultures accord­
ing to their main characteristics, because they saw no scientific way
to account for the diversity. That situation changed in the 1970s as
psychologists and evolutionary biologists extended their explanations
of behavior to include culture.
Since these explanations focused on behavior, one result of the
biologists' and psychologists' influence was to redefine culture in terms
of behavior. Before the 1970s, most anthropologists defined culture in
terms of abstractions (mentalistic concepts) such as a set of shared
values and beliefs. One notable exception was Marvin Harris, who
defined culture more concretely in terms of shared customs (behavior).
Skinner (1971), like Harris, defined culture concretely by pointing to
the practices, both verbal and nonverbal, that a group of people might
share.
Not only are customs diverse the world over, but also customs within
any group can change drastically over time. If an American of today
were transported back to colonial days, the modern would have diffi­
culty talking with the colonists because spoken English has changed
so much in the past 300 years. Misunderstandings would arise about
dress and social behavior, marriage, sex, and property. According to
historian C. J. Sommerville (1982), for example, childhood is a relat­
ively recent invention, originating in the sixteenth century. Children's
birthdays have only been celebrated regularly since the seventeenth
century.

The Evolution of Culture

In evolutionary theory, the problem of accounting for diversity
of forms coincides with the problem of explaining change, because
diverse new forms arise as a result of changes in ancestral forms. In
theories of biological evolution, for example, one imagines an ances­
tral population of bears, some of which migrated farther and farther
north and, as a result of selection, became larger and ultimately white,
to make the different species we see today.
Similarly, the problem of explaining the diversity of cultures coin­
cides with the problem of explaining change of cultures. In a theory
of cultural evolution, one might imagine an ancestral culture carried
by a group that split in two. From the ancestral customs, new customs
might arise by modification, until the cultures of the two groups hardly
resembled one another. The possibility of a parallel arises: Might cul­
tural evolution be explained by the same kind of theory as biological
evolution - as an outcome of selection acting on variation?
As mentioned in earlier chapters, the cletails of the account are
relatively unimportant. Some may prove wrong, and the explana� . .
tion of culture will change as new ideas arise. Our goals are only to
demonstrate that a behavioral account is possible and to show that the
account is sufficiently complex to be plausible.

units of selection are less obvious and more controversial, because
talking about culture in terms of behavior and selection goes against
traditional accounts. What are the parts that make up a whole culture
and enter into a process of selection?
To answer such questions, evolutionary biologists like Richard
Dawkins (1989) developed the concept of a replicator, an entity that,
once in existence, causes itself to be copied. (Even DNA cannot be
said to "copy itself," because it only enters into a chemical process that
results in a copy of the original.) To qualify as a replica tor, Dawkins
explains, the entity must possess three types of stability: (1) longevity,
(2) fecundity, and (3) copying fidelity. Reproduction takes time;
longevity ensures that the replicator stays around long enough to be
reproduced. Dawkins imagines a gene, a piece of DNA, in a prim­
ordial "soup" that existed before there were organisms. The molecule
or piece of molecule would have to be chemically stable long enough
for a copy to be made, and the longer it lasted, the more copies might
be made. After the advent of organisms, when genes in a gene pool
tended to be chemically stable, they still could be changed by radi­
ation or broken up during cell division - most importantly during
the formation of gametes (meiosis) because gametes carry the copies
that are passed on in offspring. Fecundity refers to the tendency
toward frequent copying - of two rival replicators (alleles), the one
that is copied more often will become more frequent in the gene pool.
Copying fidelity refers to accuracy. Inaccurate copies tend to lose their
parent's virtues. The copies of a successful replicator resemble it closely
- the more closely, the better.
These three requirements favor small units, because a small piece of
DNA is less susceptible to being damaged or falling apart, is quicker
to copy, and has fewer possibilities for error. If nothing offset these
considerations, replica tors would always be the smallest possible. The
requirements of stability are counterbalanced by other considerations
that favor larger units.
The factors that promote larger replicators may be summed up in
the word efficacy. A large unit can have a large effect on the phenotype
(organism) in which it is positioned, and so it can have a large effect
on its own future. If a single gene controlled the manufacture of one
entire protein molecule - say, an enzyme that would in turn control
several chemical reactions - it might ensure that its phenotype pos­
sessed traits that would lead it to live long and reproduce often.
Between the advantages of smallness (stability) and the advantages
of largeness (efficacy), replicators tend to be intermediate and variable
in size. Sometimes a relatively large piece of DNA might be stable
enough to propagate through a population. Sometimes a small piece

Biological Evolution and Culture
To draw a parallel between biological evolution, which changes a
gene pool, and cultural evolution, which changes a group's social
behavior, we need to think about selection in very general terms, the
way we did in chapter 4, where we drew a parallel between natural
selection and operant learning. Like those two, cultural evolution
also can be seen as the result of variation, transmission, and selection.
Cultural evolution, however, cannot be understood independently of
the other two, because the behavior involved is operant behavior and
depends for its acquisition on a genetic base stemming from natural
selection.

Replicators and Fitness
What are the units of selection? What are the things that vary and are
transmitted and selected? With natural selection and operant learning,
we were able to avoid this question simply by talking about genes,
alleles, and variation in operant behavior. With cultural evolution, the

might be effective enough to be selected, if it controlled a crucial bit of
structure in a protein molecule, for instance.
A particularly good way for relatively small units to achieve efficacy
might be called "teamwork." Dawkins points out that genes rarely
operate on their own. Selection favors genes that cooperate or act in
concert with other genes. Say two alleles of a gene, X and X', are
matched in fitness on all counts except that X' works together with
another gene Y to produce a more successful phenotype. The com­
bination X'Y will flourish and possibly drive out X-allele combinations
altogether. This way clusters of genes and traits can be selected clusters like lungs, breathing, skin, and sturdy limbs or feathers, wings,
flying, and building nests in trees. Dawkins theorizes that this is how
organisms came into existence; genes survived and reproduced better
when they were packaged into " survival machines."

short-term interests (cheating) to the individual's long-term interest in
maintaining the association. Such a tendency to act for the good of
others in the short run, but for the sake of greater benefit in the long
run is what we have called altruism (chapter 12).
Altruism is the hallmark of a society. When a group lives together
in a stable association and behaves altruistically toward one another,
that is a society. In a society like an ant colony, in which everyone is
closely related, altruism can be selected by the benefit to the shared
altruistic genes; between close kin there need be no reciprocity.
Between unrelated individuals, however, mutual benefit depends on
reciprocity. Along with genes for altruism, genes for remembering the
other members of the group and for accounting of debts and dues
must be selected, all as a cluster. Knowing who is who and who did
what for whom makes it possible for even a group of unrelated lions
to band together, capture large prey, protect one another, and feed
one another's offspring. (Of course, some relatedness does help.)
Not only altruism but also much other social behavior is selected
when societies are beneficial to fitness. In his studies of marmots, David
Barash (1982) found dramatic differences between woodchucks, which
are solitary, and Olympic marmots, which are social. Woodchucks live
in low-lying fertile areas with relatively long growing seasons, whereas
Olympic marmots live high in the mountains where the growing
season is short and the weather is severe. Woodchucks apparently
manage well in the milder climate on their own. They maintain territ­
ories from which they exclude others of their kind. Males and females
come together only to mate, and females keep their young with them
only until they are weaned, when the offspring disperse. For them, the
costs of a social existence would outweigh the benefits. In Olympic
marmots, selected along with warm coats are the necessities of living
in groups: greeting calls, recognition of members, alarm calls, group
maintenance of burrows, food sharing, and cooperative defense. Along
with this, offspring typically stay with the group through two or three
growing seasons; presumably they cannot be brought to maturity
quickly with this harsh climate's limited resources. Barash theorizes
that the slow maturation may be the key factor that makes the benefits
of society outweigh the costs.
For all their living in societies, would we say that ants, or even
Olympic marmots, have culture? Ants show an amazing range of
adaptations. They may be the only creatures besides humans that have
wars - group fighting to the death. Some species farm - grow edible
fungus on pieces of leaf brought into the colony for the purpose. Still,
we do not see, nor do we expect to find, culture in an ant colony. What
is missing?

258

Societies
If genes generally do better in aggregates, then sometimes they might
do even better in aggregates of aggregates. That is, sometimes it might ·
benefit genes to build survival machines that collect together in groups.
Much advantage accrues to fish that school or birds that flock. Such
aggregates offer, for example, better protection from predators and
greater efficiency in finding food than the individuals would enjoy on
their own. Groups of predators like lions or hyenas can subdue large
prey they could never capture on their own. Other things being equal,
if alleles that build social survival machines tend to survive better
than alleles that build solitary survival machines, then over time the
species will come to be found in groups.
However, it takes more than aggregation to make a society. A flock
or herd may be a sort of limited partnership, with each individual's
behavior confined to keeping close to the rest while feeding. In a
society, however, the individuals do not behave only for their own
benefit. When a group of wolves tracks and kills a moose, they all
behave together in ways that benefit them all. The behavior of each is
necessary to the attainment of the goal, and without the efforts of all
none would benefit. This is cooperation (chapter 11).
For wolves, a moose is a shared goal in a literal sense: once killed,
it is shared among the members of the group. If each individual's
participation depends on benefiting from the group's activities, then
each individual must get a share. Any tendency to cheat must be
curbed because each individual's benefits would cease if the group fell
apart. Genes will be selected that help to subordinate the individual's

259

Definition of Culture
What is missing is learning, for culture is the learned behavior of a
group. It consists of operant behavior, both verbal and nonverbal,
acquired as a result of group membership. One mIght say that ants
and Olympic marmots learn as a result of group membership because
they recognize other members of their societies. Ants kill strangers
that enter their colonies because they give off the wrong odor; a stranger
painted with the chemicals of the colony is accepted. Olympic mar­
mots greet group members and drive off strangers. These discrimina­
tions must be learned, because each ant colony's odor is unique and
each marmot society's membership is unique. Although such learn­
ing might suggest the rudiments of culture, it still seems too little to
qualify. First, the behavior involved is probably not operant behavior.
The discriminations consist of the occurrence or nonoccurrence of greet­
ing displays and aggressive attacks, which are fixed-action patterns.
The learning involved appears to be more like classical conditioning
than like operant learning; it depends entirely on context and hardly
at all on consequences. Second, no actions are transmitted from one
individual to another and nothing like instruction is involved. Operant
learning as a result of group membership implies that the behavior of
the group arranges consequences for its members. Human parents
arrange reinforcement for their children's behavior. We will return to
this shortly, but first we need to see how evolutionary theory explains
why culture exists at all.

Culture and society
For culture to come into existence, there first had to be societies, for a
culture is the possession of a society. Robert Boyd and Peter Richerson
(1985) explain that culture is a "population-level phenomenon." Like
a gene pool, a culture can only be seen when one looks at a whole
population. They compare the "pool of cultural traits" with the gene
pool. Every population has a gene pool, but only some - possibly only
human populations - have pools of cultural traits.
Just as a gene pool is transmitted from generation to generation,
so a culture pool is transmitted. A child growing up in Japan or the
United States carries part of the gene pool and eventually, as he or she
learns the customs of the culture, part of the culture pool. The child
grows into an adult, passes the culture on to other children, and then
dies. Thus, the individuals die, but the gene and culture pools go on.
Most people in Japan eat with chopsticks, whereas most people in the

The Evolution of Culture

261

United States eat with forks, knives, and spoons, but exactly who eats
in these different ways changes from generation to generation. The
individuals carry the genes and they carry the cultural traits, but the
gene pool and the culture pool transcend the individual. At the popu­
lation level, in a real sense the individuals, as survival machines and
behaving organisms, are only the means by which the gene pool and
the culture pool are transmitted.
When two societies with different cultures come into contact, rarely
does one culture so dominate the other that all traces of the sub­
ordinate culture disappear. Usually a new culture forms, comprising
elements from both. This happens because customs from each culture
compete for acceptance with customs from the other, and some win
out from one and some win out from the other. The reason that the
customs of one culture would displace the customs of another must
be linked to the reason that cultures exist at all - directly or indirectly
culture must affect fitness.

Culture and fitness
Learning like that involved in culture, from the point of view of genes,
is a risky business, for the survival machine that develops with behavior
preprogrammed is less likely to behave inappropriately. However, if
on the average survival machines that learn are more likely to survive
and reproduce than survival machines that do not, then genes for
learning will tend to survive and increase. Even if learning goes wrong
some of the time, if it is beneficial in the long run, across many indi­
viduals and over many generations, its genes will be selected.
Imagine a variable environment or, to be more accurate, several
potentially habitable environments, where resources and dangers are
too numerous and diverse to catalog easily. Consider the possibilities
of dispersion if one could survive in the tropics, in the desert, in tem­
perate climates, and in the arctic. To open all these possibilities, the
ability to learn which resources and dangers are present and how to
obtain or avoid them would be essential. Humans and other species
learn because genes that make for learning open up possibilities that
outweigh their riskiness.
A similar line of reasoning explains the existence of culture. If it is
useful to learn, it might be useful to learn from others of your kind the members of your society. That is to say, if an average benefit to
fitness can select genes that make for learning, then an average benefit
to fitness can select genes for culture. If much must be learned or if
many possibilities must be eliminated, then learning from others would

Social Issues

The Evolution of Culture

be a valuable shortcut. How can you know whether it is better to wear
shoes or what sorts of shoes would be best to wear? How better to
find out quickly than from those around you? A person living in
isolation might never arrive at an adequate solution to the problem.
Cultural transmission prevents us from having to reinvent the wheel.
If culturally transmitted traits like wearing shoes or speaking Eng­
lish can enhance the fitness of the genes in a survival machine, then
the genes that make for the traits that ensure cultural transmission
will be selected. What sorts of traits make the shortcut possible?

hears no song or only that of a related species, the marsh sparrow,
it grows up to sing only a rudimentary song, little resembling the
typical song of its species. It must hear a white-crowned sparrow song
a tape recording will do - and no other, if its singing is to develop
correctly, and its song will resemble the one that the little bird heard.
Such transmission from adult to young allows for local dialects in
the song; white-crowned sparrows from different areas sing different
variations of the song.
Human language learning appears to be constrained (guided) in
ways similar to white-crowned sparrow song-learning. The human
auditory system seems to be especially sensitive to speech sounds.
Laboratory research with infants indicates that the ability to make
important phonemic discriminations is present shortly after birth.
Other research indicates that infants can discriminate faces from other
patterns, an ability that may serve in language learning as well as
many other social outcomes.
Far from being "blank slates" on which experience writes, human
babies come into the world constructed so as to be affected by crucial
stimuli from other humans. These social stimuli are essential enough
to normal development that genes have been selected that take much
of the chanciness out of their occurrence in caretakers and their recep­
tion by infants. Parents take great interest in babies, and babies take
great interest in parents.
Just as all normal male white-crowned sparrows begin their first
attempts at song around a certain age, so do all human infants begin
to babble when they are several months old. For the sparrow's song to
develop, the bird must be able to hear itself sing. The same appears to
be true of human speech; children with chronic ear infections develop
abnormal speech (usually correctable by speech therapy).
Special sensitivities to stimuli go hand in hand with special behavioral
tendencies (like babbling). In particular, adaptive value may stem
from coupling sensitivity to the behavior of others with a tendency to
behave as they do. Special sensitivities, in other words, frequently go
together with a tendency toward imitation.

262

Traits for Culture
Transmission of learned behavior from the group to the individual
by means that we recognize as teaching or instruction requires three
sorts of traits. The first two, constraints on stimuli and imitation, allow
an individual to learn from the group but serve as the basis of only a :
rudimentary sort of culture, which we will call imitation-only culture.
The third sort of trait is social reinforcement, the addition of which
distinguishes imitation-only culture from full-blown culture. Social .
reinforcers allow the key element of human culture, instruction.

Constraints on stimuli
If learning is risky, then it is likely to be constrained - that is, guided
or directed by the structure of the organism, particularly the structure
of the nervous system and sense organs. This means that certain stimuli
are much more likely to affect behavior than others. If illness follows
ingestion, a rat is likely to avoid the taste and smell of the food that
preceded the illness. Quail and pigeons, birds that find food by sight,
avoid food that looks like what they ate before getting sick. Humans
seem to possess both biases; someone who became sick after eating
lobster Newburgh later becomes queasy at both the smell and the
sight of lobster Newburgh.
When the stimuli toward which we are biased are those produced
by other members of our species, then we learn quickly from those
others. Evolutionary biologists point out that many creatures besides
humans display this sort of sensitivity. For example, the white-crowned
sparrow shows a special sensitivity to the songs of other white-crowned
sparrows, and a young male white-crowned sparrow must hear the
song of an adult male before it can come to sing that song when it
grows to adulthood. If the young male is reared in the laboratory and

263

_

Imitation
Culture would probably be impossible without imitation. If learning
about variable environments has any fitness advantage, then imitation
also would have an advantage, because imitation would help ensure
the acquisition of appropriate behavior. To make this argument more
concrete, Boyd and Richerson (1985) consider a hypothetical population

Social Issues

The Evolution of Culture

of acultural organisms living in an environment that varies from time
to time (goes through cycles of drought and rain, for example). Imagine ·
that in each generation individuals had to learn on their own the
behavior that succeeds in the current environment: some would man­
age and some would fail. They continue:

We may call such a pool of traits transmitted by imitation alone an
imita tion-only culture; although it shares much with human culture,
a key element is missing: instruction, teaching, or training. In an
imitation-only culture, the behavior of other group members serves
only as an inducing stimulus or context. The consequences of the
imitated behavior (potato-washing) arise from nonsocial aspects of the
individual's environment (sand sticking to the potato). Instruction, how­
ever, means the two individuals have a relationship (chapter 1 1); the
reinforcement of the learner's behavior is arranged by the instructor
and usually at least some of the reinforcers (praise and approval) are
delivered by the instructor. Such social reinforcement relations push
human culture far beyond the possibilities of imitation-only culture.
We will discuss the effects of instruction on culture later. First we
turn to the way that evolution may have provided a genetic basis for
instruction by selecting powerful social reinforcers.

264

Now, consider the evolution of a hypothetical mutant "imitator" gene
that causes its bearers to eschew individual learning and copy the
behavior of individuals from the previous generation. As long as
the environment does not change too much between generations, the
average behavior of these models will be close to the currently adaptive
behavior. By copying behavior of individuals from the previous genera­
tion, imitators avoid costly learning trials, and, if they average over
a number of models, have a better chance of acquiring the currently
adaptive behavior than non-imitators. (p. 15)

In other words, individuals that imitate have a better chance at behav­
ing in ways that will result in survival and reproduction in the current
environment, so the imitator genes will tend to increase in frequency
in the gene pool.
In keeping with this line of reasoning, imitation occurs in a variety
of species, many of which we would consider acultural. Epstein (1984)
found that when a pigeon with no training is placed in an apparatu�
in which it can observe another pigeon pecking at a Ping-Pong ball
and receiving food reinforcers, it soon begins to peck at a Ping-Pong
ball on its side of the apparatus, and will still peck at the ball even
after the trained pigeon is removed. The pigeon would doubtless ceaSe
to peck after a while, but if the apparatus were arranged so that the
pecks produced food, the pigeon's pecking would be reinforced and
would move from being induced behavior to operant behavior. How­
ever, even if an entire flock of pigeons learned to peck at Ping-Pong
balls through imitation, we might still hesitate to say that pigeons
have full-blown culture, although we might grant them an extremely
rudimentary culture.
The same would apply to the group of monkeys that all learned
to wash sweet potatoes put out on a sandy beach. Researchers provid­
ing the potatoes observed that one monkey individually began wash­
ing her potatoes. A few others followed suit, and then the rest. The
spread of this trait, presumably by imitation and reinforcement, could
qualify it as part of a rudimentary culture, confined to food-washing
and a few other traits unique to the group. (See Goodenough et al.
[1993, pp. 138-40] for a summary of social learning in nonhuman
animals.)

265

Social reinforcers
For children growing up in a human culture, learning all the behavior
that they need to learn would probably be impossible without con­
tinual shaping by adults. If learning more skills and subtler discrim­
inations conferred an advantage, then genes that aided such acquisitions
would be selected.
In chapters 4 and 12 we discussed the likelihood that genes making
certain important events reinforcers (food, potential mate, shelter) and
genes making certain events punishers (pain, illness, predators) would
be selected in any species for which operant learning might enhance
fitness. The extension of this reasoning explains how subtle social cues
become potent reinforcers and serve as a base for culture. In chapter
12, for example, we saw that Dawkins included in his list of reinforcers
smiling child and in his list of punishers screaming child. Most parents
would testify that the sight of a smiling child is both a potent reinforcer
and an inducing stimulus (unconditional stimulus or releaser; chapter
4). The sound of a crying baby, though quieter than many sounds we
accept, is one of the most aversive sounds we experience, and parents
rush to feed or change diapers or do whatever might be needed to
stop the crying. No consideration of the parents' individual health or
survival can explain why a child's smile or cry should affect them so
powerfully. Taking care of the child, however, has everything to do with
the survival of genes, and a gene package that included the tendency
for such effects might well prosper. The child's smile and cry are the
means by which genes induce and reinforce caretaking by the parents.

Social Issues

The Evolution of Culture

If the child shapes the parents' behavior, how much more is it true
that the parents shape the child's behavior! Adults exhibit a variety
of behavior changes around children. They smile, gaze affectionately,
raise the pitch of their voices, all fixed-action patterns (chapter 4). For
the child, the parent's smile, regard, voice, and touch offer powerful
reinforcers, but for no obvious reason other than the advantages
of culture. If the child had nothing to learn from its parents, genes
making such subtle cues into reinforcers would never be selected.
These potent social reinforcers, however, open possibilities of cultural
transmission that far exceed those of an imitation-only culture.
Social reinforcers are especially effective because they are so handy.
Imagine a parent trying to shape a child's behavior with nonsocial
reinforcers like food and money. Each time the child makes the
desired response, the parent has to get and hand over a cookie, which
the child eats, or a coin, which the child spends later. How ungainly
and inefficient, in comparison with the ease and immediacy of a smile,
a hug, or an approving vocalization. Unlike money, these social
reinforcers are ever-available to the parent, no matter the situation.
Unlike cookies, affection can be given again and again and the child
won't get full. Ready delivery and slow satiation mean that these
reinforcers allow the child's instruction to go on during all waking
hours.

compete and various trait packages must be possible. But what are the
analogs to genes, alleles, and packages, and what are the mechanisms
of their variation?

266

Variation , Transmission, and Selection
The types of traits that we have been discussing - stimulus constraints,
imitation, and social reinforcers - not only produce culture but also
allow cultural change. Cultural evolution can occur in a manner closely
analogous to genetic evolution - that is, by the combination of vari­
ation, transmission, and selection (the selective transmission of vari­
ation). To understand how this might be, we need to answer some
basic questions. What varies and how? How are variants transmitted?
What are the mechanisms of selection?

Variation
Evolution is impossible without variation. In biological evolution,
gene locations on chromosomes must be inhabitable by various alleles,
making for a variety of gene packages and survival machines. Sim­
ilarly, cultural evolution requires that various cultural "alleles" must

267

Cultural replicators
The question " What varies?" is a question about units. In Dawkins's
terms, it becomes, "What are the replicators of culture that possess
longevity, fecundity, and copying fidelity?"
The problem here is exactly analogous to the problem of identifying
units of operant behavior (chapter 4), and the solution is much the
same. Here, as there, the units are identified by their function. A cul­
tural replicator is an activity, engaged in and transmitted by the group,
that serves a certain function, results in a certain effect, or accom­
plishes a certain result. In other words, a cultural replicator gets a
certain job done. Wearing warm clothes in the winter keeps us healthy.
Computer programming allows one to earn a living and gain status.
Like gene packages, cultural replica tors can be thought of as vary­
ing in size. Anthropologists, for example, distinguish among cultures
on a variety of grounds, some specific and some general. Producing a
specific artifact (making bowls of a certain shape) constitutes a relat­
ively small replicator; in a technological culture, an example could be
making television sets of a certain brand. Larger replicators, or pack­
ages of replica tors, are defined by clusters of interdependent customs.
Customs about marriage and family, for example, tend to go together.
In cultures with extended families, arranged marriages are the rule,
presumably because too many people are involved for the association
of two families to be left up to the vagaries of romance. Love matches
become more common as fewer people are involved beyond the
married couple themselves. In the last 300 years in the west, we have
seen a shift from extended families to nuclear families and the pre­
dominance of love matches.
Speaking English could be thought of as a replicator, though it is so
broad it is little help in understanding cultural customs. More specific
verbal replica tors would be greeting and bargaining over prices or
goods. "Hello, glad to see you" and "My donkey is worth at least three
of your sheep" can be said in a variety of languages, and the language
is usually less important than the result (i.e., the job done). Most
cultures include different greetings for different relationships (e.g.,
spouse versus employer) and the different greetings are replicators.
In some cultures, lying about the quality and origin of goods is com­
mon practice, as westerners who have bargained with shopkeepers in

268

Social Issues

countries like Turkey or India can testify. Different bargaining practices
in different cultures constitute replicators.
Meme, culturgen, practice
Different names have been proposed for the replicators of culture.
Lumsden and Wilson (1981) suggested culturgen, and Dawkins (1989)
suggested meme (rhymes with cream); Skinner (1971) used practice.
The history of science includes examples of new terms being invented
(oxygen and acceleration) and of terms being appropriated from
everyday talk (force and response). For our present purpose, we will
stick to words like practice and custom, which remind us that cultural
replica tors are activities.
Among evolutionary biologists, discussion of cultural evolution has
been handicapped by a failure to recognize that cultural replicators
are activities. Lumsden and Wilson and Dawkins write of the evolu­
tion of beliefs, ideas, and values. The belief, idea, or value that stealing
is wrong, if thought of as a thing, could never evolve by natural mech­
anisms because it is nonnatural. The problems with mentalism that we
discussed in chapter 3 apply to cultural practices as much as to any
other type of operant behavior. No understanding is gained by imagiri­
ing that the units of cultural evolution are mental entities (Boyd and
Richerson, 1985) or unknown neural structures (Dawkins, 1989). Such
explanatory fictions remain superfluous as ever and cannot explain
how cultural practices originate and change, a question that demands
attention to history and behavior over time for its answer (chapter 4).
Just as the frequency of a gene in a gene pool can be assessed only
across all the individuals in a population, so the frequency of a prac­
tice can only be assessed across all the individuals in the group. For
example, more American women wear lipstick today than they did in
the 1970s and fewer wore lipstick in the 1970s than in the 1950s; such
cultural changes could be measured only by studying many women.
The thing that changes in frequency, across women and over time, is
the practice (wearing lipstick) itself; that is, the replicator. Clusters
of practices that function as replica tors are category labels (Ryle) or
aggregate activities (in the molar view; chapter 3). For example, "dis­
approving of stealing" is an activity composed of parts like punishing
theft and telling children not to steal (chapter 3). Since it denotes some­
thing natural, a set of interdependent actions, it denotes something that
could evolve by the natural process of selection: Group members may
punish stealing, may reinforce behavior incompatible with stealing, and
may talk about how wrong stealing is ("Thou shalt not steal"), all of
which may be selected insofar as they reduce the frequency of stealing.

The Evolution of Culture

269

That talk is part of culture deserves emphasis. Among the practices
of a culture are traditional utterances: sayings, stories, and myths. In
New Hampshire, the saying " If it ain't broke, don't fix it" is part of the
local culture. Part of ancient Greek culture was its myths. Particularly
important to culture are utterances that in chapter 8 we identified as
rules. These include moral injunctions (Thou shalt not steal), instruc­
tions (Always say "Please" and "Thank you"), and knowledge of the
environment (You need a warm coat around here in the winter). Even
the stories and myths of a culture resemble rules, because they usually
convey lessons or morals - that is, they point to customary reinforce­
ment and punishment. The story of the boy who cried "Wolf," for
example, contains a lesson about verbal discriminative stimuli, reli­
ability, and reinforcement. C. J. Sommerville (1982), in his book about
childhood, argues that even children's fairy stories about brave young
men, fair maidens, dragons, and wicked stepmothers serve socially
useful functions, indirectly teaching lessons about life and encourag­
ing confident interaction with the world. He writes, " [T]hey offer
something that must precede moral development by encouraging
the child to choose sides. By sympathizing with one character and
against another, the child acquires the habit of identifying with those
he wishes to emulate" (p. 139). In other words, like moral injunctions,
the fairy stories of a culture help engender behavior that will be
reinforced by the practices of the group. When biologists and anthro­
pologists talk about the "beliefs," "ideas," and "values" of a culture,
they are probably referring particularly to the culture's traditions of
verbal behavior.
We may distinguish rule-making from rule-giving as we would dis­
tinguish invention from repetition. People make up rules from time to
time, in the sense that they produce novel utterances of the form of
injunctions, advice, or instructions. Only some of these become part
of the culture's characteristic rule-giving, which spreads from person
to person and generation to generation by imitation coupled with
reinforcement. Rule-making and rule-giving are both parts of human
culture.
The particular rule-giving that goes on in a group helps distinguish
one culture from another and changes in a culture from one period
to another. A young man of marriageable age in India today may be
told by his parents, "When you meet the woman we have picked for
your wife, if you don't like her, you may refuse." In the United States
he may be told, " When we meet the woman you have picked for your
wife, if we don't like her, we may refuse." Three centuries ago, he
might have been told something more like the young man in India.
Rules vary from place to place and time to time.

270

Social Issues

Social reinforcement and punishment
In every culture, certain actions are reinforced or punished by mem­
bers of the group. A child's obedience to parents results in approval
and affection. Lying, cheating, and stealing result in disapproval
and rejection. These customs of social reinforcement and punishment
constitute the most important practices of the culture, because they
form the base for cultures that go beyond the possibilities of imitation­
only culture. The operant behavior we call teaching, guiding, or
instructing consists of reinforcing behavior that is normal for the
culture and punishing behavior that is deviant. As operant behavior,
the teaching itself also must be reinforced, often by the students' cor­
rect behavior, but also by other practices within the culture, such as
paying a salary.
Skinner (1971, 1974) regarded social reinforcement as so important
to human culture that he suggested the word practice should refer only
to such relations. In his view, social reinforcement shapes the behavior
"
that is normal for the culture. Since the behavior results from the
reinforcement relations, the relations are more basic than the behavior.
Thus, to know a culture would be to know its practices of reinforce­
ment and punishment. The making of bowls of a certain shape would ·
be secondary; the reinforcing of making bowls of that shape would be
a primary part of the culture. Whether cousins marry or not would
be secondary; whether proposals of marriages between cousins were
reinforced or punished would be primary.
Skinner's position has two main implications. First, it rules out
imitation-only cultures and limits the possibility of culture in nonhuman
species. (The nonhuman species would have to engage in operant
behavior that had the effect of reinforcing the imitative behavior of
other group members. The spread of potato-washing from parent to
offspring would not be enough; the parent would have to reinforce
the offspring's potato-washing.) Second, Skinner's view shifts focus
away from a difficult and possibly unanswerable question: How many
group members must behave in a certain way before that behavior
is "characteristic" or "normal" for the culture? Sktnner answers, in
effect, that the number is irrelevant, as long as some members of the
group reinforce that behavior in others. Even if just a few group
members reinforce the behavior, it will persist as part of the behavior
of the group.
Evolutionary biologists differ with Skinner on both points. First,
those who recognize the importance of instruction define culture as
consisting of behavior learned as a result of group membership. This
definition draws no line between imitation-only cultures and those

The Evolution of Culture

271

including instruction; nor does it draw any line within a culture
between behavior acquired by imitation combined with nonsocial
reinforcement (e.g., potato-washing) and behavior acquired as a result
of interactions with another group member (i.e., as a result of a rela­
tionship, in the sense of chapter 11). For this more inclusive view, it
would be enough that group members serve as models; they need
not also be the source of reinforcement. Second, they get around the
question of what is normal for the culture by likening the culture to a
gene pool. In a culture pool, certain practices may be common and
others may be rare. What matters is whether they remain in the pool
or disappear.

Mutation, recombination, and immigration
If a culture pool is like a gene pool, then it must contain within it the
means for novelty. In the gene pool, three processes make for novelty:
(1) mutation constitutes a source of new alleles, (2) recombination,
or " crossing-over" - the breaking and rejoining of DNA that occurs
during meiosis - arranges new combinations of alleles, and (3) immig­
ration of individuals from one population to another allows whole
new combinations to appear in the gene pool. Analogs to these three
processes occur in the culture pool.
The cultural analog to mutation is accident or error. We already dis­
cussed the impossibility of repeating the same action exactly. Variation
is inherent in behavior, and some variants may be more successful
than others. Another type of accident may be imposed by some
uncontrollable environmental event. When I injured my right hand
I was forced to brush my teeth with my left hand and discovered I
could do a better job on the teeth on the right that way. Now I switch
hands when I brush. When you are prevented from doing things in
the usual way you may discover better ways of doing them. Finally, as
with genetic replication, copying errors occur. An athlete may imitate
a tennis coach incorrectly and discover a better way to serve the ball.
A child may imitate a parent imperfectly and discover a better way to
tie shoes. As with mutations, however, most mistakes are for the worse;
happy accidents that turn out for the best are rare.
A possible behavioral analog to recombination is failure of stimulus
control. You might make a wrong turn driving home, or put on the
wrong item of clothing, or say something inappropriate to a relative,
even though you have behaved correctly hundreds of times in the
same situation. Patterns of behavior that ordinarily remain separate
get mixed this way. Although such mixing is usually disastrous,

272

The Evolution of Culture

occasionally it may lead you to discover a better route, a better mode
of dress, or a better way of interacting with your relatives.
As immigration introduces novelty into a gene pool, so immigra­
tion may introduce novelty into a culture pool. This occurs when
individuals from one society enter another society. For example,
westerners living in Japan during the nineteenth and twentieth cen­
turies transferred many practices into Japanese culture. Immigration
into the United States has introduced new methods of cooking, new
verbal expressions, new ways of doing business, and new forms of
religion.
Novel practices may enter the culture also by immigration from a
subculture - that is, from a set of practices characteristic of a subgroup
within the society. The effects of immigration into the United States
have often been delayed because an ethnic group has remained par­
tially segregated from the rest of the population, moving into the main
culture only over several generations. Almost all Americans know the
meaning of expressions like jive, pasta, and chu tzpah even if they don't
know their origins.

from parent to child may play no direct role, but genetic inheritance
from parent to child may also guide or bias cultural transmission;
children may be disposed to learn certain activities as a result of genes
they have inherited. For example, child and parent might share a dis­
position toward acquiring fear of heights, learning music, or learning
manual skills.
Since, however, transfer of genetic material can be irrelevant to cul­
tural transmission, one's genetic parents may differ from one's cultural
parents. A child may acquire cultural practices from a variety of adults
- uncles, aunts, teachers, ministers, coaches. People may also acquire
practices from peers; children typically learn the "code of the play­
ground" from other children, and adults are " shown the ropes" of a
situation by other adults. Such transmission, impossible for genes, is
called horizontal. Since horizontal transmission occurs within genera­
tions, cultural practices can spread through the group even within the
span of a single genetic generation.
This means that cultural evolution is much faster than biolOgical
evolution. Whereas genetic transmission is limited to only one point
in an individual's life, cultural transmission occurs throughout the
lifespan. Cultural transmission allows new traits to displace old ones
throughout even a large population in the space of just a few years.
Sometimes the speed of cultural evolution relative to biological evolu­
tion creates problems; examples are our present problems with our
"sweet tooth" and nuclear weapons. The practices of making sugar
and weapons have evolved too fast for the genes underlying our
attraction to sweet taste and our aggressive tendencies to decrease at
all in the gene pool. Instead, other practices have evolved to offset the
bad effects of the earlier ones. We diet and brush our teeth; we engage
in peace talks and disarmament.

Transmission
The second essential ingredient for evolution by selection is transmis­
sion from one generation to the next. In biological evolution, transmis­
sion occurs by the transfer of genetic material (DNA) from parent to
offspring. In cultural evolution, it occurs by more direct means: the
transfer of behavior from one group member to another.

273

Inheritance of acquired characteristics
Before the twentieth century, traits were thought sometimes to be
passed from parent to offspring by direct transfer, so that characteristics
acquired by the parent might appear in the offspring. If a blacksmith's
arms grew muscular as a result of his work, then the muscular arms
might be passed on to his children. Although the notion never found
any evidence to support its operation in biological evolution, inherit­
ance of acquired characteristics is exactly the means of transmission in
cultural evolution.
In a culture-possessing species like ours, children tend to learn
whatever their parents learn. Everything from modes of dress to table
manners to dialect to social mannerisms may be passed directly from
parent to child. For some cultural traits, transfer of genetic material

Imitation
One way that acquired cultural traits are transmitted is by direct copy­
ing - imitation. In biological evolution, copying of DNA occurs during
the formation of gametes, and the DNA then affects the develop­
ment of the individual into which it is transferred. This is relatively
uncertain and indirect compared with the direct copying of phenotype
comprised by imitation.
Children imitate adults and other children. Adults usually imitate
other adults, but sometimes they imitate children. Slang expressions
used by children, such as far ou t and totally awesome, tend to slip into
the speech of adults who hear them.

Social Issues

The Evolution of Culture

Imitation provides a base for operant learning. Once an action has
been induced by imitation, it can be reinforced and shaped into more
evolved forms. Once a child utters abbuh, listeners' responses (approval
and giving apples) reinforce and eventually shape it into apple. If no
reinforcement occurs or the action is punished, it remains at a low
frequency or disappears. One child may hit another, imitating aggress­
ive behavior shown on TV, but whether the aggression continues
depends on whether the behavior is reinforced or punished.
We may distinguish learned imitation from unlearned imitation.
Imitation in pigeons and monkeys is probably unlearned, and much
imitation in children (and perhaps adults) is unlearned in the sense
that it requires no special experience. It is as if some of our genes
instructed the body, "Watch and listen to people around you, and do
as they do." Without instruction, a small child watching a parent
hammer nails will pick up a hammer and pound a board.
Unlearned imitation combined with shaping explains why children
learn to speak and behave socially as those around them do. Even
adults away from their home regions or countries may pick up speech ·
dialects and social mannerisms without noticing.
Learned imitation is another matter. It is a type of rule-governed
behavior, in the sense of chapter 8. When one person tells another to
"do like this," the ability of the one being instructed to behave appro­
priately depends on a history of reinforcement for imitating in such
situations. The transition from unlearned to learned imitation may
occur in many different contexts: in the home, when parents say, " Look
at me"; on the playground, when a peer says, " Look what I can do"; in
the classroom, when the teacher plays games like Simon Says.
Although unlearned imitation allows speedy cultural transmission,
learned imitation speeds it even faster. With learned imitation, a single
social episode may suffice to pass on a practice. One person says to
another, " Comb your hair like this," and the other immediately does
so. Assuming that the environment provides reinforcers - social or
nonsocial - for the behavior, it will persist.

sensitivity toward stimuli from their parents, particularly their speech
sounds, and because of their susceptibility to the social reinforcers
delivered by their parents.
Woe to the child that fails to learn to follow rules, for that child will
fail to acquire all sorts of socially acceptable behavior. Many of the
utterances that a parent directs at a child are equivalent to statements
of the form " In our culture, we do X, and X is reinforced by members
of our group" or " In our culture, we avoid doing X, and X is punished
by members of our group." Such rules point to relations we usually
call conventions. A parent tells a child, "Say bye-bye," " Hold your fork
in your left hand," or "Shake hands when you meet someone," and all
these actions are reinforced by members of the group. The parent tells
the child, " Don't hit Uncle Zack," " Don't pick your nose in public,"
or "Don't laugh too loudly," and all these actions are punished by
members of the group.
Such conventions derive their power ultimately from the benefits of
group membership to fitness. In the terms of chapter 8, the ultimate
reinforcement takes the form " If you behave so, then you will be
eligible for the protection and sharing of resources that go on in this
group." To deviate too far from acceptable behavior is to risk ostracism.
In the public TV series The American Experience, one episode describes
the plight of a woman who lived during the early nineteenth century
in a remote town in New England, had given an illegitimate baby up
for adoption when she was a teenager living away from the town, and
then unknowingly married her own son many years later. When the
mistake was discovered, the son was removed and the woman was
ostracized. Although a few people took pity on her, she was even­
tually left to starve to death in a shack on the edge of town. Nowadays,
people who are cast off like this wind up "on the streets."
Social conventions differ from rules pointing to reinforcement and
punishment that directly affect personal health and welfare. " Dress
warmly in winter" is good advice in a temperate climate regardless of
whether any other group members approve. Social conventions are
value statements that point to reinforcement and punishment that is
predominantly social. They often include words like should and ought.
A parent in the US might say to a child, "You should never steal from
your friends, but a little cheating on your income tax is okay." As we
saw in chapter 12, should and ought point to ultimate reinforcement
and punishment. In social conventions, including moral statements like
" Honor thy father and thy mother," both the proximate and the ultimate
reinforcers and punishers are delivered by other group members. In
the HRRR of chapters 8 and 12, ultimate reinforcement of social con­
ventions involves the last two R's : relationships and reproduction.

274

Rule-governed behavior
Learned imitation is an example of a more general type of cultural ·
transmission: transmission by rules. One of the earliest lessons that
children learn is to obey their parents and other authorities. Rather
than merely to imitate, they are taught to do as they are told. When
a conflict arises, they are told, "Do as I say, not as I do." No doubt
children are predisposed to learn rule-following, because of their

275

Social Issues

The Evolution of Culture

Selection
Besides variation and transmission, evolution of the practices in a cul­
ture pool requires some mechanism of selection. In biological evolu­
tion, selection occurs because of differential survival and reproduction.
Something analogous must be true in cultural evolution. As with genes,
some variants among the cultural replicators are longer-lived, more
fecund, or more faithfully copied.

Selective transmission
Individuals (survival machines) that indiscriminately copied whatever
practices occurred around them, might fare poorer than individuals
that copied selectively. Ones that imitated selectively might be more
likely to acquire the most adaptive behavior, provided that some handy
criterion - some manifest character - serves to guide the selection.
The best rule for selective imitation would be imitate success. In a
variable environment, in which the best clues to adaptive behavior are
the activities of those around, a gene or set of genes that contained this
directive would fare better than others. Genes, however, could never '
code any directive so abstract; instead, they would need to guide imita­
tion toward concrete criteria that generally correlate with success. Boyd
and Richerson (1985), for example, point out that circumstances might
often make it more useful to imitate individuals other than one's par­
ents. "For example, offspring frequently must emigrate. Individuals
native to the new habitat are likely to be much better models than the
immigrant's biological parents" (p. 15). In such a situation, how could
one know who or what to imitate?
One concrete criterion that Boyd and Richerson suggest is frequency.
The commonest actions - the norms - are likely to be the ones that have
proven most successful. Arranging for the most frequently encountered
activities to be imitated would be relatively simple. It could be achieved,
for instance, just by slowing imitation down, so that several exposures
were required for an activity to be copied. Such a rule could go wrong
if some better practice were less frequent, but it need only increase
fitness on the average and in the long run for the genes to be selected.
A second possible concrete criterion might be: imitate those indi­
viduals encountered most frequently. In our species, these would
usually be the biological parents, but they could be adoptive parents,
uncles, aunts, teachers, or friends. Genes for recognizing family mem­
bers and significant others could be selected for a variety of reasons
besides guiding imitation - for example, guiding altruism toward kin

.

277

or toward those who are likely to reciprocate. The rule "Charity begins
at home" might be coupled with the rule " Imitation begins at home."
Imitating frequently encountered individuals, like imitating frequently
encountered activities, entails some risk. Human beings seem to imitate
the adults who rear them, often with good results but sometimes
regretfully. People who were abused as children may swear never to
strike their own children, but may find it difficult to refrain when they
actually have children. From the genes' perspective, such copying of
maladaptive behavior would be offset as long as copying one's parents
was advantageous most of the time - on the average and in the long run.
To imitate less frequent activities or individuals other than one's
parents, one would need yet another criterion of success. In his poem
"The Road Not Taken," Robert Frost wrote, "Two roads diverged in a
wood, and I - / I took the one less traveled by, / and that has made all
the difference." What was that difference?
A successful activity is an activity that is reinforced, and a success­
ful person is a person whose activities are reinforced. People tend to
imitate activities that are reinforced and to imitate other people who
possess reinforcers. Motorists in a traffic jam usually stay in their lanes,
which is the socially correct (reinforced) thing to do, but if one car
goes whizzing by all the others in the breakdown lane with no appar­
ent punishment, several more are sure to follow suit. Typical role
models for children and adults are people with wealth and status movie actors, professional athletes, politicians, corporate executives people whose behavior is highly reinforced.
Genes could code for the tendency to imitate successful activities
and people by causing an increase in the tendency to imitate when­
ever reinforcers are present. This would be equivalent to an instruc­
tion such as "Whenever you see events in your list of reinforcers,
imitate the people around them." Alternatively, the tendency could be
largely or entirely shaped by the culture. Children could be instructed
to imitate success: "Look at your uncle Gideon, wouldn't you like to
be rich like him when you grow up?"
Whether provided mostly by genes or mostly by culture, the tend­
ency to imitate activities and people associated with reinforcers
constitutes a powerful selective force. It explains why even relatively
rare practices can spread in a social group. In the early part of the
twentieth century, automobiles were rare, and many horse owners
scoffed at them. As the advantages (more reinforcement and less
punishment) of cars over horses became more apparent, however, the
practice of automobile ownership spread and, within a generation, all
but eclipsed horse ownership. This change probably never could have
occurred so rapidly if it were not for selective imitation.

278

Social Issues

Rule-following and rule-making
The same considerations that tend to make imitation selective also
tend to make rule-following selective. People often follow commands
and advice, for example, but not just any commands and advice. Just
as we are more likely to imitate practices that occur frequently in the
culture pool, so we are more likely to follow rules that occur fre­
quently in the culture pool. In this way, dominant practices tend to be
carried on. While growing up, a child may hear so much on all sides
about the wrongness of stealing that he or she may become extremely
careful to avoid even the appearance of stealing. The high frequency
of exhortations against violence may explain why so few children
imitate the violence they see on TV.
As we are inclined to imitate successful people, so too we are
inclined to follow rules given by successful people. If you were lost in
New York City, who would you ask for directions - a person sitting
on the sidewalk dressed in rags or a person striding along dressed in
expensive clothes? We are disinclined to follow advice given by people
who show few signs that their behavior is reinforced, but we are some­
times willing even to pay money for advice from people who show
the signs of success (buying books about how to succeed in business,
gardening, or weight control).
Along with the tendency to imitate success, the tendency to follow
rules given by manifestly successful people explains how a rare prac­
tice can spread rapidly through a culture pool. When videocassette
recorders became available at reasonable prices, the majority of house­
holds in the United States bought them within just a few years.
This rapid spread of the use of VCRs was largely due to advertising
and word of mouth - that is, successful people (people whose behavior
is reinforced) telling other people that their purchase and use of a
VCR will be reinforced. Testimonials in advertisements capitalize on
our tendency to follow rules given by successful people. The people
urging you to buy the product are usually famous and always good­
looking, expensively dressed, and well-spoken.
In their book Programmed to Learn, Ronald Pulliam and Peter Dunford
tell a story called "The Legend of Eslok" that illustrates how culture is
shaped by variation combined with selective transmission. In it, we
see some people succeeding and others failing and the growth of a
rule in response to short-term reinforcement in conflict with long-term
effects on fitness. Here is a brief retelling.
Once upon a time, long ago and far away, there was an agricultural
community, a village, in a remote fertile valley. The people were

The Evolution of Culture

279

neither poor nor rich - they managed to get along. One day, Mephisto­
pheles came to the village in the form of an old man. He befriended
some of the farmers, and offered them gifts such as seeds and tools. At
first, they hesitated to accept the gifts, but after a while a few accepted.
Almost at once, those farmers began to prosper. Their harvests were
bigger than all the others. Seeing their success, the other villagers began
accepting the old man's gifts also. Soon everyone was prospering, and
Mephistopheles left.
The villagers had no way of knowing that a few years after a family
accepted the gifts, all their children would die. Since every family in
the village had accepted the gifts, all the children died. Finally, when
all the adults were growing old and dying, a man named Eslok left the
community and the valley to travel.
Eslok journeyed many days, until he came to another community.
He settled there and told the people the story of the old man and the
gifts. After Eslok died, the story was still told, and a moral was added:
"Beware of strangers bearing gifts."
Several generations passed, and Eslok's story came to be regarded
as a myth. Eventually, the community became overpopulated, and
some adventurous young people set out to found a new community.
They traveled far in search of a good place, and came upon the fertile
valley, now uninhabited, that had been Eslok's home. They settled,
became established, and grew into a village.
Once again, Mephistopheles came offering gifts. As before, some
people accepted the gifts. This time, however, some people remem­
bered the saying, "Beware of strangers bearing gifts," and refused
the gifts. After a few years, the children of those who accepted
began dying. On seeing this, the villagers drove Mephistopheles from
their midst. Since some people had refused the gifts, the community
survived the disaster and returned to their modest lifestyle. After­
wards, it became a firm rule in the village: "Never accept gifts from
strangers."
The story shows how both rule-following and rule-making depend
ultimately on their enhancing fitness. The rule about strangers was
made in response to disastrous effects on fitness, and those who fol­
lowed it avoided disaster.

Self-interest
In The Selfish Gene, Dawkins emphasizes that replica tors - whether
genes or practices - act out of self-interest; they promote themselves in
the sense that their effects tend to increase the frequency of their own

280

Social Issues

The Evolution of Culture

reproduction. Yet many genetically coded traits and many cultural
practices seem to promote the survival of the group or the culture,
often at the expense of the individual survival machine. We saw in
our discussion of the benefits of sociality how genes may be selected
that make for subordination of the individual's welfare in favor of the
group - those genes need only do better on the average and in the
long run than genes that put the individual's short-term benefit first.
This is the explanation of apparent altruism and cooperative behavior
in general.
Something similar might be true of cultural replicators, which also
could increase at the expense of the individual survival machines.
As a result of imitation and rule-following, soldiers go off to war and
are often killed. When weapons were primitive, the genes that make
for affiliation with the group and obedience to authority were prob­
ably benefited by war. As a result, the cultural practices of war could
survive and flourish, because they were reinforced on the average
and
.
in the long run (e.g., by increased goods and territory).
The analogy to genes suggests further that certain practices may ·
be selected because they help maintain other practices. Such practices
would tend to be conservative - that is, would resist cultural change.
For example, xenophobia could be explained this way: killing or
driving off strangers would help protect the culture from invasion
by foreign practices, thereby helping all the other practices of the
culture to survive. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
Japanese culture successfully resisted influence from western visitors
by extreme xenophobia. Not until modern warships came to their
shores and further resistance became dangerous did this resistance
crumble. The short-term benefits of xenophobia might explain the
resistance, whereas the long-term welfare of the people might explain
the eventual opening up to western culture.
The logic of evolutionary theory dictates that cultural evolution must
operate within limits set by biological evolution (Boyd and Richerson,
1985). Before culture ever came into existence, genes were selected
that set those limits by setting limits on what can be learned and what
can be reinforcing. In the short run people may engage in practices
that are reinforcing but deleterious to health or reproduction, but in
the long run they tend to act to preserve health and foster reproduc­
tion. This is the reason why the ultimate reinforcement of rule­
governed behavior concerns fitness (chapter 8). When a conflict occurs
between cultural practices and the fitness of genes, the conflict is even­
tually resolved by change in the culture. One of the points implied by
the Legend of Eslok is that when short-term success (accepting the
stranger's gifts) conflicts with long-term reproductive success (the

dying children), then new practices (giving the rule " Never accept
gifts from strangers") evolve to compensate. For example, when prac­
tices evolved that made sugar readily available and the manufacture
of candy profitable, people began to consume more and more sugar
and candy. In the US, the long-term cost to health slowly became
apparent, and practices such as tooth-brushing and using sugar sub­
stitutes evolved. Similarly, the hazardous effects of building nuclear
weapons are being offset by the move toward disarmament. In the
final analysis, cultural change is guided by the welfare of our genes.
This point will be especially important to us in chapter 14, which
concerns purposeful cultural change.

28 1

Summary
A group's culture consists of learned behavior shared by the members
of the group, acquired as a result of membership in the group, and
transmitted from one group member to another. Evolution of culture
occurs in a manner parallel to shaping of operant behavior and bio­
logical evolution - by variation coupled with selective transmission.
The units of selection - the things that vary and are selectively trans­
mitted - are replicators. A replicator is any entity that promotes its
own copying. A good replicator possesses longevity, fecundity, copy­
ing fidelity, and efficacy.
One requirement for culture is society. A true society includes
cooperation - apparently altruistic behavior that benefits others in the
short run and benefits the altruist in the long run. A second require­
ment for culture is the ability of group members to learn from one
another, for this is how cultural practices are transmitted through time.
In biological evolution, the pool of replica tors possessed by all the
organisms in a population is known as the gene pool. In cultural evo­
lution, the pool of cultural practices possessed by a society is called
the culture pool. These practices constitute the replicators of culture,
and as they are passed along in the culture pool, their frequencies may
wax or wane, depending on how often they are learned.
When learning from others benefits the learner's genes in the long
run, as in our species, traits that make learning from others likely are
selected. Three such traits are constraints on stimuli, imitation, and
social reinforcers. Our bodies are so constructed that we are tuned to
stimuli produced by other people, such as faces and language sounds.
If one organism imitates another, and the result is reinforced, then
rapid operant learning takes place. Social reinforcers such as smiles,

282

The Evolution of Culture

Social Issues

pats, and hugs allow still more and faster learning from others
because they introduce the practices of teaching and instruction.
The replicators of culture (practices) are the activities of group mem­
bers passed along by imitation and instruction. These units are defined
functionally, like operant activities, because they are operant activ­
ities. They include not only nonverbal practices like dietary selection
and manufacturing, but also verbal practices like stories, sayings, and
moral injunctions. These verbal practices serve useful functions either
because they offer rules or because they offer instruction analogous
to rule-giving - that is, they provide discriminative stimuli inducing
behavior that is socially reinforced. Human culture includes practices
of following rules, giving rules, and making rules. All of these depend
on reinforcement relations arranged by other people - social reinforce­
ment and punishment. These practices of social reinforcement and
punishment, apart from the behavior they produce, may be the most
fundamental replicators of human culture.
The first ingredient of evolutionary theory is variation. Just as genes
vary, so cultural replica tors vary. Like genetic accidents, behavioral
accidents occasionally are beneficial. Like a gene pool, a culture pool
can profit from immigration.
The second ingredient is transmission. Unlike genetic transmission,
cultural transmission means inheritance of acquired characteristics.
The possibilities for cultural transmission far exceed those of genetic
transmission, because those transmitting a practice - cultural parents
- may be genetically unrelated to the ones receiving it - cultural
offspring. Cultural transmission also differs from genetic transmis­
sion in that, whereas genetic transmission occurs only at conception,
cultural transmission occurs throughout the lifespan. Many sources
and many opportunities for cultural transmission mean that cul­
tural evolution occurs much faster than biological evolution. Social
problems arise when cultural evolution changes the environment in
such a way that a tendency that enhanced fitness in the old environ­
ment makes for a practice detrimental to fitness in the new environ­
ment. When such problems arise, new practices tend to evolve to
offset them.
Cultural transmission occurs by imitation and by rules. Learned
imitation is a form of rule-governed behavior. Children are taught
to follow rules because transmission of practices by rule-following is
especially fast.
The third ingredient in cultural evolution, selection, occurs because
transmission is selective. If the organism is likely to fall into a variety
of environments, mechanisms might evolve by which transmission
would be biased toward receiving practices that are successful in a

283

particular environment. One likely criterion of success is frequency.
People might imitate frequently encountered practices and frequently
encountered individuals. Rule-following might be selective in a way
even more directly related to success, if people tended to follow rules
coming from people whose behavior is frequently reinforced.
The idea that cultural practices are replicators analogous to genes
helps explain why people often act to their personal detriment for
the good of their community or country. "Selfless" practices (donating
money, time, effort, and risking one's life) will remain part of the
culture as long as the consequences are reinforcing on the average and
in the long run. The social reinforcers that maintain such practices
derive ultimately from their effects on fitness of genes.

Design of Culture:
Experimenting for Survival

Perhaps nothing Skinner had to say stirred up more controversy than
his ideas about design of culture. Critics saw in this phrase the spectre
of totalitarian government, regimentation, and stagnation. It seemed
to them a dangerous idea, a formula for disaster. How could anyone
be wise enough to design a culture? What would happen to people
who disagreed with the design? Fueling the fire of such objections,
Skinner wrote also of behavioral engineering, which sounded even
more ominous.
Although some behaviorist ideas - about free will, mind, and lan­
guage, for example - are truly controversial, design of culture and
behavioral engineering only seem like controversial ideas when they
are interpreted in the light of common prejudices about the words
design and engineering. To the critics, these words suggest something
like a master plan, a fixed idea about how a culture should run, that is
put into action whether anyone likes it or not. However, the logical
extension of a behavioral analysis of freedom (chapter 9), government
(chapter 11), and values (chapter 12) leads to no such idea. The view
advanced in Skinner's Beyond Freedom and Dignity and Walden Two, for
example, resembles more the process of trial and error that engineers
and designers go through when they are trying to create a product
that works. An architect designing a house makes a sketch, perhaps
builds a model, examines this prototype for flaws, and tests it by
showing it to the client. At any point in the process, and particularly
if the client rejects the design, it's back to the drawing board. Few
people object to government-funded experimental projects like job­
training or tax incentives; they seem to be legitimate attempts to get
people to behave in socially desirable ways. As we will see, behavior
analysts suggest only that we should engage in such experimentation
more systematically and more generally.

Design of Culture: Experimenting for Survival

Design from Evolution

Evaluation

Once we recognize that culture changes by an evolutionary process as
a result of variation, transmission, and selection; then we should be
able to act to enhance that evolution by improving on all three aspects.
We could increase and guide variation by purposefully trying out new
practices. We could guarantee transmission by teaching practices we
consider good (in the sense of chapters 12 and 13) in schools. We could
sharpen selection by training experts to evaluate experimental programs.

Selective Breeding
Darwin's ideas about natural selection came partly from studying
selective breeding. He had no definite theory about how traits passed
from one generation to the next, but he knew that animal breeders
were able to improve their stock by breeding parents that possessed
the sorts of traits they wanted in the offspring. Horses could be bred
for speed, cows for size and milk production. Darwin reasoned that
if the environment arranged for some members of a population to
be more likely to become parents, even if in a relatively haphazard
manner, then over time the population would tend to comprise
more and more individuals possessing the traits that make for greater
reproductive success.
Selective breeding differs from natural selection in one important
way: purposefully choosing which members of the population get to
reproduce results in more powerful selection. As selective breeding
is to natural selection, so design of culture is to evolution of culture.
Just as agricultural experts can experiment, selectively breed, and pro­
duce improved strains that farmers can use, so it should be possible
for cultural experts to experiment, evaluate, and produce improved
practices that society can use.
Such experimentation occurs to some extent already. In the 1930s,
many people viewed Social Security and unemployment benefits as
experiments, and more recently many viewed affirmative action as an
experiment. Occasionally individual states try out new practices - for
example, negative income tax to help the poor and lotteries to fund
education. Most experiments with new practices occur on a smaller
scale in cities, school districts, or even a city block - trash recycling,
parental choice of schools, crime watch. Some experiments prove in­
effective or disastrous, as with negative income taxes and deregulation
of savings and loan institutions.

287

Design of culture means only that we do more experimenting and do
it more carefully - that is, with planning and evaluation. When experi­
ments are undertaken with no plan for evaluation, then decisions on
whether they have succeeded or failed require that their results be spec­
tacular. The results of cultural experiments, however, are likely to be
subtle - changes, for example, in the frequency of certain events (teenage
pregnancy or drug-related deaths) or individual performances within a
group (scores on standardized tests). Even if some people change a lot,
some may change less, and some not at all. Thus, evaluation demands
more than casual observation: data must be gathered and analyzed.
Just as laboratory scientists must use statistical tests and graphs to
decide about the results of experiments, so cultural experimenters must
use similar methods. This is why agencies that fund new experiments
often require a plan for evaluation before a project is approved.
Large-scale funding usually depends also on small-scale demonstra­
tions, or pilot experiments. Should a cultural pilot experiment go wrong,
its small scale allows relatively quick detection and easier remedy of
any ill effects. Trying deregulation initially on a small scale might
have averted the US savings and loan catastrophe. Even if deregula­
tion seemed to have worked well in other contexts (and in the absence
of careful evaluation, this remains debatable), the savings and loan
institutions represented a new context in which deregulation should
first have been evaluated in a pilot experiment.
Evaluation, however, raises a question. In agricultural experiments,
breeders assess new strains according to definite goals or standards,
such as resistance to disease and productivity. Everyone may agree
about the success or failure of some cultural experiments, but many
experiments leave room for disagreement, because our conclusions
depend on the standards we apply. Someone viewing state lotteries in
the light of the revenue they produce might consider them highly
successful, but someone looking at the way they draw the revenue
primarily from lower socioeconomic groups might regard them as a
dismal failure. By what sorts of standards should cultural experiments
be evaluated?

Survival As a Standard
In addressing this question of standards, Skinner often wrote of sur­
vival. Sometimes, when looking at global problems, he seems to have

288

Design of Culture: Experimenting for Survival

Social Issues

meant simply the survival of the human race. At other times, how­
ever, he wrote about the survival not of peoples but of their cultures.
To survive, a culture must be able to change, for only in a world
without new environmental challenges and competition from other
cultures could a particular culture remain stable . . In today's world,
since the environment is deteriorating and global communication
allows constant contact between cultures, survival depends on coping
with environmental changes and absorbing practices from other
cultures. Practices compete, not only within a culture, but between
cultures. If a foreign practice proves reinforcing, it moves into the
indigenous culture and may even replace traditional practices. The
Japanese adopted mass production and quality control from the west;
Americans today enjoy sushi and karate. Since practices tend to occur
in clusters and depend on one another, adopting one practice often
leads to adopting others. A person interested in karate may become
interested in Zen; the Japanese adoption of mass production led to
their adoption of quality control. Interdependence of practices leads to
competition between large cultural patterns and even whole cultures.
When a group drops its traditional culture and adopts another whole­
sale, the traditional culture can be said to have died.
In a changing environment, if one culture changes to meet new
challenges and another does not, only the first is likely to survive.
Such challenges are particularly crucial when they are produced by
the culture's practices themselves. For example, the practices of manu­
facturing nuclear weapons and dumping toxic wastes threaten the
welfare of generations to come. A great deal depends on how a culture
responds to these self-created challenges.
Survival as a standard implies not only change, but change in
response to long-term relations. Responding only to short-term rela­
tions usually spells disaster, because short-term and long-term rela­
tions usually conflict. In the short run, plastic bags have proven popular
with Americans because they are convenient and cheap; in the long
run, they wind up in landfills and pollute the environment. Their real
cost is high, in the long run, because it includes satisfactory disposal.
In the short run, fossil fuels seem a convenient and cheap source of
energy, but in the long run, their use promotes traffic jams and air
pollution.
Most of the problems we face constitute reinforcement traps in the
sense of chapter 9. Acting in accordance with short-term consequences
is reinforced relatively immediately; the reinforcement is obvious.
Long-term relations, however, present difficulty because their con­
sequences are usually delayed and incremental. The discharge of a
little toxic waste into a stream may have no major lasting consequences,

289

but discharging a little every day for years may eventually produce a
disaster because of the cumulative effect.
If individual companies cannot be relied upon to respond in accord­
ance with long-term relations, then regulatory reinforcement relations
need to be imposed. Electric companies cannot be expected to encourage
conservation, as long as consumption of electricity raises their profits.
In Maine, the public utilities commission has experimented with a
way to remove this disincentive to conservation. To keep the electric
company's profits roughly constant, they arranged that, if consump­
tion decreases, the rates go up. The result has been that consumption
has declined. When promoting consumption was no longer reinforced
and the company began to encourage conservation (or at least ceased
to encourage consumption), individual consumers were more likely to
conserve. The regulatory reinforcement brought the company's beha­
vior into line with the long-term relations that favor conservation.
Responding to such long-term relations requires prediction, often
guesswork. Sometimes action should be taken even if the prediction
is uncertain. For example, it appears that our practices of consuming
wood and fossil fuels, which release large quantities of carbon dioxide
into the atmosphere, may result in a warming of the entire earth the greenhouse effect." The connection, however, is far from certain
because temperature rises and falls for other reasons. A general upward
trend might take many years to confirm. If we wait until we are sure
there is a problem before taking action, it may already be too late to
avert a disaster.
Only small numbers of experts can be trained to make guesses about
long-term environmental, economic, and social consequences. A soci­
ety is forced to rely on these specialists to reveal long-term relations
and to recommend new practices to deal with them. These recom­
mendations, however, can produce change only if the society includes
groups who respond to the experts' verbal behavior and work for the
survival of the culture. Groups who encourage people to recycle waste,
for example, play this role.
Whether they help people to eat a better diet or to conserve electricity, new practices that solve problems generated by the old practices
they replace have two effects: they ensure the survival of the culture,
and they promote the long-term reproductive success of the society's
members. In chapter 13, we saw that the likeliest explanation of why
societies and cultures exist at all is their enhancement of fitness.
Practices change so as to increase the fitness of the practitioners, or,
with problems produced by our own practices, to prevent significant
decrease in fitness. In discussions of the need for change, people often
talk about the health and survival of their children and grandchildren.

Guided Variation
In their book, Culture and the Evolutionary Process, Boyd and Richerson
(1985) took what Skinner called design of culture so much for granted
that they gave it a technical name - guided variation - and listed it as
one of the forces of cultural evolution. They equate guided variation
with behavior that is individually learned and then transmitted by
imitation or teaching. This is broader than Skinner's notion, because
it includes instances involving no verbal behavior - say, one creature
learning by trial and error, and others imitating it. Boyd and Richerson
concentrate, however, on what they call rational calculation, which
corresponds to Skinner's precurrent behavior (chapter 8). Precurrent
behavior, such as experimenting with diets or trying out biodegradable
plastics, results in solutions that set the occasion for verbal behavior,
rules such as "Eat more leafy vegetables for better health" or "Use
biodegradable plastic bags to prevent pollution." These rules induce
rule-governed behavior in those who listen, and this rule-governed
behavior must ultimately be reinforced.
Boyd and Richerson introduce reinforcement in the form of an
"adaptive standard" :
The effect of the guided variation force on evolution depends on the
existence of some adaptive standard such as taste or a sensation of
pleasure or pain. For example, adaptation through rational calculation
proceeds by the collection of information about the environment, the
estimation of the results of various alternative patterns of behavior, and
the evaluation of the desirability of the alternative outcomes according
to some criteria. It is these guiding criteria that translate variation in
the environment into a directional, often adaptive, change in phenotype,
which then is culturally transmitted to subsequent generations. The
source of these criteria clearly must ultimately be external to the guided
variation process itself. In the final analysis, we will be driven to explain
the guiding criteria as the product of some other process. (p. 9)

Interpreting the mentalistic phrasing here, we see that "taste or a
sensation of pleasure or pain" corresponds to the reinforcing and
aversive properties of various consequences (children, wealth, nausea,
and so on), and " criteria" means reinforcers and punishers. The phrases
"collection of information" and "estimation of results" correspond to
precurrent behavior, some verbal and some perhaps manipulative,
that produces various discriminative stimuli (outcomes) that control
further verbal behavior. A "change in phenotype" here means a change
in some practices of the culture. The "source" or "process" responsible

Experimenting
Skinner (1971) compared experimenting with cultural practices to
experimenting in the laboratory:
A culture is very much like the experimental space used in the analysis
of behavior. . . A child is bom into a culture as an organism is placed
in an experimental space. Designing a culture is like designing an
experiment; contingencies [i.e., reinforcement relations] are arranged and
effects noted. In an experiment we are interested in what happens, in

than ready to step in and fill the reinforcer void with a contingency sys­
tem of their own. They are skilled at the techniques of reinforcer sampling
and shaping. Soon, Friendly will have a new repertoire. (pp. 6-7)

292

Skinner points here to the difference between behavior analysis, the
science, and behavioral technology. Whereas the science aims only to
understand, the technology aims at practical results. The technology
and the science are partially interdependent: the science explains why
practices might work, and the technology draws on the science to
discover practices that actually do work.

Democracy
For example, we speculated in chapter 11 that democracy may be
superior to earlier systems of government because it provides the
citizens with greater counter-control. This theory might point the
way to further improvements on the democratic process. In an article
called " From candidate to criminal: The contingencies of corruption
in elected public office," behavior analysts Mark Goldstein and Henry
Pennypacker addressed the single greatest threat to democracy: corrup­
tion. They reasoned that corruption occurs because the reinforcement
relations that affect behavior of candidates running for office differ
from the reinforcement relations that affect behavior of officeholders
after they are elected. While running for office, the candidate raises
money and wins votes by promising to represent the people's inter­
ests, reform poor government practices, and listen to the voters' con­
cerns. After being elected, the person now faces a new and almost
irresistible set of reinforcement relations: well-funded special interest
groups offer gifts and contributions if the official will make decisions
in their favor, while other elected officials encourage acceptance. At
the national level, a representative or senator suddenly becomes the
object of lobbyists who point to the need for a large fund when the
time comes for re-election. At the local level, similar relations occur,
even if the stakes are lower, because developers and businesses demand
zoning concessions and special services. Their representatives take the
officeholder to dinner, offer tickets to baseball games and vacation
travel. Goldstein and Pennypacker (1998) describe the situation of a
person named Friendly:
[Friendly] the candidate experienced an enriched schedule of personal
contact, support, feeding, and positive public feedback from campaign
workers. Most of this ceases after the election, making the officeholder
extremely susceptible to any other reinforcers. Those who would seek
favorable treatment (i.e., those who would corrupt Friendly) are more

293

The officeholder's succumbing to the new powerful reinforcement
might be remedied at the polls when election time returns, but then
the problem remains that a new person will succumb all over again to
the same change of reinforcement relations. A solution to corruption
requires some change in the relationship between officeholder and
constituents that provides more counter-control.
Goldstein and Pennypacker suggest a possibility for locally elected
officials. They describe their proposal this way:
All elected officials would be subject to a plebiscite on each anniversary
of their election. Annually the voters would be asked one ballot ques­
tion with respect to each incumbent: Should he or she be retained with­
out challenge for an additional year? An affirmative majority vote would
allow the incumbent to continue service without challenge. A negative
vote, on the other hand, would be an invitation to challenge in the next
annual plebiscite and could result in replacement. Under this system, a
newly-elected incumbent would be assured of serving for at least two
years. Thereafter, each unchallenged year would presumably function
as positive feedback from the public concerning the incumbent's per­
formance. If the vote to challenge occurred, the incumbent would have
the succeeding year to amend his or her practices in order to prevail
in the ensuing election. Failure to so reform would presumably lead to
timely removal by the voters. This procedure would add nothing to the
cost of local government since some form of election usually occurs
annually and the plebiscite would simply be superimposed. (p. 7)

Since their proposal ensures more frequent feedback (reinforce­
ment or punishment), backed up by the threat of removal from office
(counter-control), it would promote correct behavior as long as the
incumbent remained in office. It would remove some of the disadvant­
ages of fixed terms of office: that officeholders are for some years
insulated from counter-control and then are forced to face challenge
by election even if they are doing a good job. Although the proposal
might sound reasonable, however, the only way to find out if it would
work would be to try it.

Happiness
How do we know when a practice works? This brings us back to
Boyd and Richerson's adaptive standard and guiding criteria. The

Social Issues

Design of Culture: Experimenting for Survival

commonest answer is couched in terms of happiness. What works is
what makes people happy.
This, however, only results in restating the problem: Under what
conditions are people said to be happy? We have already seen
(chapters 9, 11, and 12) how behavior analysts approach this question.
First of all, people report greater happiness when they are free from
threats of aversive consequences (or removal of accustomed reinforce­
ment). In chapter 9, we noted that people report happiness when
their environment provides choices (alternative possible actions) and
those choices have reinforcing consequences rather than aversive con­
sequences. People tend to be happy in the same conditions in which
they report feeling free, especially from coercion, but also, as our
analysis of spiritual freedom suggested, from some types of positive
reinforcement.
One qualification has to be made about happiness as a criterion of
what works in a culture: We are speaking here of happiness in the
long run. Long-term happiness derived from one's culture often con­
flicts with short-term personal reinforcement. In the short run, no one
enjoys paying taxes, but everyone benefits from schools and trash
collection in the long run.
In chapter 11, we introduced a longcterm perspective by examining
exploitation and equity. The reinforcement and punishment relations
of a culture are manifested concretely in relationships, which consist
of the repeated exchange of discriminative stimuli and consequences
by which people control one another's behavior and organizations
control people's behavior. People report greater long-term happiness
when they are free from exploitive relationships and receive equitable
reinforcers - that is, reinforcers equivalent to those received by a com­
parison group. Historically, the tendency in the US has been toward
making broader and broader comparisons. Wives are compared not
just with other wives, but with husbands. Minorities are compared not
just with other minorities, but with the majority. Ultimately, if the
population at large became the comparison group, everyone's stand­
ard for equity would be the same.
In chapters 12 and 13, we reminded ourselves that, ultimately,
because we are products of natural selection, our happiness tends to
coincide with the fitness of our genes. For most people, happiness
(reinforcement) derives from conditions in themselves and others
(reinforcers) ultimately tied to fitness : personal survival and comfort,
the welfare of children, the welfare of family members and other relat­
ives, and the welfare of nonrelatives with whom we have mutually
beneficial relationships (chapter 1 1 ) - spouse, close friends, members
of a community.

Walden Two: Skinner's Vision

294

295

One way Skinner tried to convey his idea of the experimental, or
experimenting, society was by describing one in his novel Walden Two.
As a novel, the book offers concrete illustrations of what an experi­
menting society might be like. As an essay advocating the virtues of
the experimenting society it is indirect because Skinner makes his points
through dialogue between character s. To appreciat e the book fully,
you have to interpret it in light of Skinner's viewpoin t.

Interpreting

Walden Two

The book begins with two middle-aged college professors, Burris
and Castle, deciding to visit an experimental community located in
Midwestern farm country. They find an attractive layout of buildings
and land with about 1,000 inhabitants. The days they spend there are
dominated by conversations with Frazier, the originator of the com­
munity, who lives there but has become peripheral to its operation.
One way to read the book is as a battle between Frazier and Castle
for the loyalty of Burris. Castle, described as comfortable in his role as
an academic, is an overweight and verbally pugnacious philosopher the personification of mentalism. Frazier, the man of action, is described
as vigorous and argumentative, confident to a fault. He represents the
hope of a new world based on behavioral technology. Burris, uncom­
fortable as an academic, dissatisfied with his life, is open to persua­
sion. None of the three can be said to represent Skinner, although we
can imagine that the discussions that occur among them, especially
between Frazier and Burris, might resemble arguments Skinner had
with himself.
As Frazier shows them around Walden Two, Burris and Castle
learn about the various aspects of the culture, the practices concern­
ing economics, government, education, marriage, and leisure. Frazier
explains how the practices are founded on behavioral principles.
Castle finds fault and urges mentalistic arguments, which Frazier
rebuts. Burris vacillates. One after another, objections to the idea of
the experimenting society are raised - most by Castle, some by Burris
- and answered.
Every aspect of Walden Two is portrayed as working better than
in the US at large. No money is needed; people earn labor credits for
doing useful work - more credits per hour for onerous work (washing
windows), less for enj oyable work (teaching). The government is so
responsive to feedback from the citizens that elections have become

297

Social Issues

Design of Culture: Experimenting for Survival

obsolete. Children are taught how to educate themselves and require
only loose guidance from teachers. The people enjoy enormous amounts
of leisure time and use it productively. Dress is varied. Social inter­
actions are direct and kind. Most of all, everyone is happy. Burris even­
tually goes through a sort of conversion experience, leaves Castle on
their way back to the university, and returns to Walden Two to stay.

A Mexican community, Los Horcones, has retained the practice of
experimenting, but remains too small to have much influence.
Perhaps the growth of cultural experimentation need not rely on
small communities. We could argue that since the Great Depression
all levels of government, municipal to federal, show an increased tend­
ency to experiment. Newspapers often describe pilot projects testing
new ways to deal with trash collection, drug use, teenage pregnancy,
unemployment. Practices in other societies come up for discussion
and possible adoption. A pessimist might point to the power of
entrenched interest groups to oppose innovation, whereas an optimist
might say we are moving, slowly and haltingly, toward the experi­
menting society after all. Skinner would probably insist that we should
move faster and more systematically to deal with our (behavioral)
problems, before it is too late.

296

Is

Walden Two

utopian ?

Of course, Walden Two seems too good to be true. The book has often
been classified as a utopian novel, like Thomas More's book Utopia.
Many such novels have been written, usually about some small isolated
community where life is far better than in the world we know. On the
surface, Walden Two conforms to this mold.
Skinner, however, denied that the book was utopian, maintaining
that it aimed to portray the basic idea of an experimental (experiment- .
·
ing) society. The concrete particulars of economics, government, social
life, and so on were included only by way of illustration. Unlike
typical utopian novels, in which the particulars are the point of the
book, Walden Two points past the particulars to a method: the experi­
mental method. To take the particulars as Skinner's recommenda­
tions is to misread the book. Indeed, the logic of Skinner's position
would preclude his having any definite idea of the particulars of
Walden Two, because those would have to evolve over time as a
result of experimentation and selection. Who knows whether the labor
credit system, government by constant feedback, or self-education
would work? In an experimenting society they could be tried, modi­
fied, and retained or dropped.
Over the years, utopian has gained the additional meaning of
"impractical" or " unworkable," and Walden Two might be called
utopian in this sense. You might say that experimentation could be
fruitful in a community of 1,000, but could never be implemented in a
country of 300 million or even a state or city of any large size. So, even
if a community like Walden Two succeeded, it would remain a little '
island unto itself. In the book, Skinner imagined other communities
like Walden Two springing up around the country. Eventually, he
implied, enough people would live in such communities that they
would begin to influence the nation at large.
It is hard to know whether Skinner's guess will prove correct, because
attempts to start such communities have had little success. One com­
munity started in the US during the 1960s, Twin Oaks, survived into
the 1990s but by then it had abandoned the practice of experimenting.

Objections
In Walden Two and Beyond Freedom and Dignity, Skinner attempted to
answer the objections to his vision of the experimenting society. He
started with the point that, whether anyone likes it or not, a behavioral
technology - rudimentary perhaps, but growing - already exists. No
doubt remains that people's behavior can be controlled by designed
reinforcement relations. The question is how this understanding will
be used.
The first objection runs like this: The vision is false, because even if
it is possible to control the actions of people in the laboratory, those
conditions are artificial and simplified, having nothing in common
with the complexities of the everyday world. Skinner answered by
pointing out that the experiments of physics and chemistry are equally
artificial and simplified, yet no one doubts that their results can
be applied in the everyday world. Control need not be perfect to be
useful - the advertising industry demonstrates daily that history can
be exploited. Happily, more constructive uses occur also - behavioral
management in classrooms and mental institutions, for example. In
Walden Two, Frazier suggests that failures have occurred, but that the
technology unquestionably works. Skinner (1971) urged those who
would reject behavioral technology because it is too simple to examine
the alternative:
the really great oversimplification is the traditional appeal to states
of mind, feelings, and other aspects of the autonomous man which a

Social Issues

Design of Culture: Experimenting for Survival

behavioral analysis is replacing. The ease with which mentalistic
explanations can be invented on the spot is perhaps the best gauge of
how little attention we should pay to them. And the same may be said
for traditional practices. The technology which has emerged from an
experimental analysis should be evaluated only in comparison with what
is done in other ways. What, after all, have we to show for nonscientific
or prescientific good judgment, or common sense, or the insights gained
through personal experience? It is science or nothing, and the only solu­
tion to simplification is to learn how to deal with complexities. (p. 160)

practices for schools, prisons, and hospitals. As they make themselves
useful, their role may grow.
A third objection takes design to mean stagnation. Planning would
produce a stultifying environment with no room for innovation. As
we discussed earlier, this view misinterprets " design." A strength of
the experimental approach is that it encourages innovation. Any happy
accident can be exploited, and any promising new proposal can be
tried. But should we rely solely on happy accidents?
A related objection sees design to lead to regimentation and uni­
formity. If certain styles of dress or food preparation were judged
best, then everyone would be obliged to conform to those. Only the
products judged best might be available in stores. This fear overlooks
its own basis, the value of diversity. The history of western civilization
teaches us that people are happier when they have choices. The kind
of diversity that we enjoy today not only can be preserved by plan,
but could be increased. If diversity has value, we can design for it.
A fourth, and more well-aimed, objection is that such a society would
be no fun. Skinner (1971) put it, " 'I wouldn't like it,' or in translation,
'The culture would be aversive and would not reinforce me in the
manner to which 1 am accustomed' " (p. 163). Life in a community like
Walden Two, where there is no privation, little danger, and lots of
leisure, where everyone is healthy, pleasant, and unstressed, might be
dull. In a world without suffering, would there be a Dostoevsky or a
Mozart? Skinner acknowledged that this criticism had some merit,
and he doubted that he himself would wish to live in Walden Two. In
answer, however, he pointed out that this society would be good, not
for us who live in today's world, but for the people who would live in
it. In Walden Two, Frazier makes this point to Castle and Burris. Frazier
himself is described as a Walden-Two misfit. He loves the community,
but as a product of the ordinary culture he finds himself ill at ease in
the new culture he helped to create.
This "I wouldn't like it" criticism has less to do with the idea of an
experimenting society than to do with the idea of a welfare state. If
the experimenting society set as its criteria for choosing good practices
that they produce comfort, health, order, and safety, then we would
move toward a welfare state in which everyone's behavior would
be positively reinforced as much as possible, and we would move
away from coercive relationships and most aversive control. For many
people this would entail a large change in the reinforcers and rein­
forcement relations that control their activities. Productive and creative
activity might be explicitly reinforced. Presumably there would be
little need to "prove oneself," to compete with the next person, to cheat,
to steal, or to lie.

298

He went on to acknowledge that behavior analysis, like any other
science, cannot answer every question. As it progresses, however, it
produces answers to more and more of the puzzling problems we
face:
A science of behavior is not yet ready to solve all our problems, but
it is a science in progress, and its ultimate adequacy cannot now be
judged. When critics assert that it cannot account for this or that aspect
of human behavior, they usually imply that it will never be able to do
so, but the analysis continues to develop and is in fact much further
advanced than its critics usually realize. (p. 160)

A second objection equates design with meddling. Unwise innova­
tions could lead to catastrophe: we will try some experimenting, fail­
ing to foresee its consequences, and do damage instead of good. Rather
than risk unforeseen consequences, we would do better to let events
take whatever course they will. Skinner answered this by pointing
out, "The unplanned also goes wrong." If we refrain from intervening,
we leave our fate to accident. That may have worked well enough in
the past, but in a world where our actions threaten our very existence,
to sit by and hope for the best seems irresponsible.
Skinner's Walden Two community includes a group of Planners,
each of whom serves for a certain term. They assess practices on the
basis of feedback they receive from the Managers, each of whom is
attached to a certain job-defined group - health, dairy, food prepara­
tion, child care, and so on. The Managers gather the data; the Planners
analyze it. Using the data, the Planners decide which practices work,
which could be improved, and which new practices to try.
The Planners are experts; they must have the training to evaluate
and to design innovations. Responsible government relies on experts
to suggest solutions to complex problems. As with problems like
setting standards for bridge construction or evaluating new drugs, so
with behavioral problems like pollution and crime - solutions require
experts. Behavior analysts are increasingly being called in to design

Design of Culture: Experimenting for Survival

Whether or not such a world sounds dull to someone living in
today's world, if we moved to make the changes, the move would be
gradual. Even the imaginary Walden Two evolved over a period of
time. Most of us would probably welcome what changes could occur
in our lifetimes, and each generation would grow up in a culture
substantially different from the one before. They would be unlikely to
find it dull.
The biggest objection to design of culture is that it threatens demo­
cracy and will lead to dictatorship. Alongside of the utopian novel are
what might be called nightmare novels, like George Orwell's Nineteen
Eighty-Four and Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. Orwell imagined a
totalitarian state in which behavioral principles were used to frighten
people into compliance. Practically all the methods used by the
state are coercive, and even though the people are miserable and con­
stantly in fear, the state is powerful enough to maintain itself. One is
reminded of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. In Huxley's book,
the populace is kept in line with positive reinforcement. There is no
privation, but everyone becomes addicted early in life to a pleasure­
giving drug, something like cocaine, which is made abundantly avail­
able. People are taught to spend their time enjoying promiscuous sex,
games, and light entertainment, and they are kept ignorant of literature,
philosophy, science, or any part of what we regard as the heritage of
an educated person.
Two points can be made in response to the concern raised by
these novels. First, how realistic are these nightmares? Orwell's
society reminds us of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, neither of
which lasted. As we noted in chapters 9 and 11, coercive relationships
are inherently unstable; people eventually escape or rebel. Huxley's
nightmare seems more worrisome, only because the use of positive
reinforcement he depicts seems unlikely to breed rebellion. The
management methods he describes are exploitive. As we saw in
chapter 11, people rebel against or act to change exploitive relation­
ships only when they perceive inequity - that is, only when a com­
parison is made to a better-off group. In Huxley's novel, although no
such comparison is made, the ruling class leads a much better life than
those they exploit. One can only wonder how this ruling class would
prevent people from making comparisons. In hierarchical societies of
the past, like ancient Greece and Rome, even members of the ruling
class often spoke out against inequity. In the long run, exploitive man­
agement, too, is unstable.
Second, stable management includes effective counter-control
(chapter 11). The relationship between the governors and the gov­
erned cannot be a relationship between peers or even equals. Such a

relationship can be stable, however, if the means of counter-control go
beyond the simple threat of disruption. In a democracy, the threat of
rebellion hardly arises, because the people have alternative forms of
counter-control - elections, lobbying, and demonstrations.
A second essential feature of democracy that we noted in chapter 11
is that, in the long run, rulers and ruled share the same reinforcement
relations. When the ruler's term of office expires, the ex-ruler again
becomes an ordinary citizen. The same laws apply to the ex-ruler as
the rest of the citizenry. Shared reinforcement relations constitute an
additional, long-term form of control over the ruler's behavior; actions
taken while the governor is in office ultimately have the same effects
on the governor as on the rest of the community. Such long-term
relations need to be supplemented, however, by the relatively imme­
diate relations of counter-control, which affect the governor's actions
more because they are shorter-term.
Yet, after all is said in its favor, democracy as practiced in the United
States is far from perfect. As a method of counter-control, elections are
unsatisfactory, because they provide feedback only after a delay of
years; to provide more immediate consequences for the governors'
behavior, elections should be frequent, but frequent elections might be
disruptive. The proposal by Goldstein and Pennypacker might allow
less frequent elections with less disruption, at least at the local level,
but other problems remain. When an election occurs, often as few as
half of the eligible voters actually vote. Those who do vote cannot be
assumed to have considered the issues, because campaign propaganda
often fails to cover the issues. Since conducting an election campaign
is expensive, wealthy people exert more than their fair share of influ­
ence. Delegation of power (over reinforcers) also presents problems,
because appointees may be less susceptible to counter-control than
those who appoint them. Most Americans can tell stories of frustrat­
ing encounters with bureaucrats. The person who takes your applica­
tion for a driver's license may be rude to you with impunity because
you have no idea what to do about it, and you need this person's
cooperation to get the license. The degree of variation from one office
to another can be astonishing. Whether it is a government office, a bank,
or a grocery store, in the well-run organization the service people are
courteous and helpful. What makes the difference? What makes an
institution well run?
In Walden Two, Skinner guessed at answers and solutions to the
questions of what is good about democracy and how it could be
improved. The Planners have fixed terms of office, of course, so that
they share reinforcement relations with everyone else in the long run.
There are no elections, however. Instead, Skinner proposed reliance

301

Social Issues

Design of Culture: Experimenting for Survival

on frequent opinion polls and solicitations of suggestions, mostly by
the Managers. He may have anticipated today's concern with "com­
munication." When we examine what people mean when they speak
of communication, particularly in discussions about management, it
appears that they are talking about counter-control. Bureaucrats and
service people are responsive and courteous when listening and cour­
tesy are reinforced. Since customers have relatively little means to
reinforce it, the reinforcers have to come from higher-ups. This depends,
however, on the higher-ups' acting to be aware of the behavior of the
supervisees and instructing them how to behave. (This " acting to be
aware" - observing - and instructing must themselves be reinforced,
too.) When the higher-ups thus "communicate" with their supervisees,
not only is appropriate behavior toward customers increased, but also
customers gain more counter-control. The favorable and unfavorable
responses of customers make more of a difference because they are
observed. Skinner suggested that a government could be similarly
well run. In his vision, the Managers (service people) took polls of
their constituents (customers) so that the Planners could be aware
of the effects of the practices they enacted. In other words, the polls
provided discriminative stimuli that, besides reinforcing and punish­
ing the Planners' behavior, also served to induce action (maintenance
or change). Polling the US public has increased to the point where it is
almost continual; such a practice might be put to good use.
The problems we face today seem formidable. There is reason to be
pessimistic about our ability to solve them. We hear still about the
need to change people's minds, without a recognition that we need to
change people's behavior and that changing their minds usually doesn't
work. We hear still about the need for more punishment to prevent
unwanted behavior. As long as mentalistic talk about feelings and
inner self dominate the discussion, as long as moralistic talk induces
the use of aversive control instead of positive reinforcement, we will
fail to approach our problems as behavioral and to use behavioral
techniques to solve them. We need to plan, experiment, and evaluate.
Will we make the needed changes of reinforcement relations soon
enough? As long as long-term consequences fail to control our policies,
as long as short-term consequences continue to control our behavior,
disaster seems inevitable.
Still, there might be cause for optimism. Although short-term con­
siderations may dominate in our culture, we appear to be tending
toward more control by long-term consequences. In the past, each gen­
eration has bequeathed ever-greater problems to the next - pollution,
weapons, debt - by acting only on the basis of short-term considera­
tions. As we move from one crisis to the next, practices evolve that

may finally avert the crises. Such practices inevitably depend on
experts who can assess and predict likely long-term relations. They
depend also on enough informed and outspoken citizens acting to
provide discriminative stimuli and consequences for those who govern.
Judging from news reports, experts and concerned citizens seem to
be succeeding little by little in instigating new practices for protecting
the environment, reducing poverty, and improving health in many
countries of the world, including the United States. These practices
are increasingly being evaluated and compared with alternatives.
Whether we wanted it or not, whether we thought it possible or not,
we may be moving toward Skinner's experimenting society anyway.
Let us hope so.

Summary
Although behavior analysts' recommendations about design of cul­
ture have sometimes generated opposition, understood properly they
are hardly controversial. The concept of design, far from suggesting
some fixed plan to be imposed on people whether they like it or not,
implies a process of experiment and assessment in which practices are
selected according to the long-term happiness of the people. Design
in this sense relates to cultural evolution analogously to the way that
selective breeding relates to natural selection. Just as selective breeding
takes advantage of genetic variation and transmission by purposefully
selecting traits, so cultural design takes advantage of cultural vari­
ation and transmission by purposefully selecting practices. Systematic
experimenting and selection will speed cultural change in response to
social and environmental problems.
Experimental practices aim for survival - survival of the society, but
more often survival of the culture (the way of life). To survive in the
long run, a culture must change in response to shifts in the environ­
ment and must adopt practices on the basis of their long-term con­
sequences. Predicting the likely outcomes of various practices requires
that data needed to detect long-term effects be gathered and analyzed
by trained experts. Adoption of new practices depends on the conclu­
sions of such experts. Change often depends also on groups within the
society responding to the experts' predictions by "working for change"
- that is, by engaging in verbal behavior that generates discriminative
stimuli promoting new practices.
The selecting standard for survival and change of a culture is rein­
forcement. A successful practice is one that provides more long-term

304

Social Issues

reinforcement (or less long-term punishment) than the variants with
which it competes. Experimenting and selecting the more reinforcing
alternative corresponds to precurrent behavior, which promotes vari­
ous possible solutions to a problem and then may lead to verbal
behavior about solutions and nonsolutions - that is, behavior that is
and is not reinforced.
Ultimately, change and survival of a culture depend on fitness.
Unconditional reinforcers and punishers, social and nonsocial, result
from natural selection. Since they are the proximate means by which
the genes responsible for them have been selected, practices selected
by their consequences enhance fitness in the long run.
An experimental society, according to Skinner, is one that experi­
ments with and selects new practices on a regular basis. A better name
might have been the experimenting society. Skinner's novel Walden
Two depicts such a society. It has been called utopian, in the sense
that it describes a relatively isolated, idyllic community. This is a mis­
reading of the book, because the concrete particulars of the commun­
ity served only to give substance to the main point, the experimental
method of cultural design. A better reading treats the novel as an
essay in which the characters raise and answer the common objections
to design of culture.
These objections include that behavioral techniques cannot work
in the real world, that design will result in catastrophe or regimenta­
tion, and that an experimenting society would be no fun. These are
readily answered: behavioral techniques have been shown to work
in the real world; experimentation aims to avoid catastrophe and to
encourage diversity; cultural change is gradual, and the culture of
the experimenting society will be suited to the histories of those who
live in it.
The biggest objection is that cultural design will lead to dictator­
ship. Dictatorship, however, depends on coercion or exploitation, rela­
tionships that are inherently unstable. If it is an experimenting society
that aims at people's happiness, it can hardly be dictatorial, because
people are happy when their behavior is positively reinforced and
they are free from coercive and exploitive relationships. Stability and
happiness depend on equity and counter-control, the two hallmarks
of democracy. Elections as a means of counter-control might be
replaced by some more efficient means of communication, but that
would enhance democracy, not curtail it.
Although humanity today faces unprecedented problems, we may
have reason for hope. The more we experiment and gather data, the
more we listen to trained experts, the more informed citizens call for
better practices, the more likely it is that we will succeed.
